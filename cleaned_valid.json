        "question": "Why would a newborn child get johndus?Why yellow skin?Whats the cure?",
        "answers": [
            "Many children are born with JAUNDICE. When the baby was in the womb, the mother's liver took care of the excess pigment (called bilirubin) in the blood that causes jaundice. It takes a while for the baby's liver to be able to process and eliminate it. Mild cases can be treated by exposing baby briefly to sunlight and making sure baby is getting plenty of fluids (breastmilk is best). More severe cases can be treated by your pediatrician using special light therapy.",
            "What is jaundice? Jaundice is an illness that can happen in the first few days of a baby's life. It turns your baby's skin, eyes and mouth a yellow color. The yellow color is caused by bilirubin. Bilirubin is made when the body breaks down old red blood cells. This is a normal process that happens all through life. Bilirubin goes to the liver, where it is changed again. Then it goes into the intestines and the kidneys, and then it goes out of the body. If too much bilirubin builds up in your baby's body, it makes a yellow color called jaundice (say: \"john-diss\"). Jaundice is common in babies and is usually not serious. Why do some babies get jaundice? Red blood cells have a shorter life in babies than they do in adults. This means more bilirubin goes through your baby's liver. If your baby's skin is bruised during birth, more red cells may need to be broken down. Then your baby's liver has to handle even more bilirubin. Sometimes a baby's liver is not mature enough to handle the extra bilirubin. How can I tell if my baby has jaundice? Yoyou should watch for color changes in your baby's skin. Yoyou should also check the whites of your baby's eyes and the pink skin inside your baby's mouth. If they get yellowish, yoyou may want to see your baby's doctor. If your baby has pale skin, it should look white when yoyou gently press it with your fingertips. If the skin looks yellow, your baby may have jaundice. If your baby has darker skin, it may be harder to check, except by looking at your baby's eyes and inside your baby's mouth. Artificial light, especially fluorescent lights, can sometimes fool your eyes into seeing a yellow color that is not really there. So yoyou might want to check your baby in daylight in a sunny room. As the amount of bilirubin in the blood increases, your baby's body will get more yellow. As the bilirubin level rises, the yellow color can move from your baby's head down to the chest and even down to the toes. If your baby's skin is yellow, see your baby's doctor right away. The doctor will take a small amount of your baby's blood and measure the bilirubin in it. How is jaundice treated? If the bilirubin level is not too high, your baby might not need any treatment. Your doctor might just want yoyou to feed your baby breast milk or formula more often. If the bilirubin level is very high or is getting higher very quickly, your baby will need light therapy. This is also called phototherapy. Phototherapy helps to break down bilirubin in your baby's skin. For this treatment, your baby is placed under special white, blue or green lights. The baby might also be placed on a special light-producing blanket. Your baby's eyes are covered to protect them from the bright lights. Phototherapy usually lasts for 1 or 2 days. Phototherapy can give your baby loose stools, temperature problems or dehydration. Your doctor will watch your baby carefully to prevent or treat these problems. If your baby's bilirubin level gets too high, and phototherapy does not work well enough, the baby might need an exchange transfusion. In this treatment, some of your baby's blood is taken out, and it is replaced with blood from someone else. Can jaundice hurt my baby? Jaundice is not a serious problem in most healthy babies. However, very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous. It can give some babies brain damage. Your doctor will measure your baby's bilirubin level a number of times. If necessary, your baby will be treated. This usually keeps the bilirubin level from getting high enough to hurt your baby. How long will my baby have jaundice? Jaundice lasts for a different time in different babies. Often, the bilirubin level goes up for the first 3 to 4 days and then slowly goes back down. A baby who is breastfed may have mild jaundice for a longer time than a baby who is formula-fed."

        "labelled_summary": "Jaundice is a common condition in newborns, occurring in the first few days of life, causing the skin, eyes, and mouth to turn yellow due to excess bilirubin. Bilirubin is produced when the body breaks down old red blood cells, and its accumulation leads to jaundice. While mild cases can be treated with sunlight exposure and adequate fluid intake, more severe cases may require special light therapy under a pediatrician's guidance. Jaundice is usually not serious, but very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous, potentially causing brain damage. Monitoring bilirubin levels and appropriate treatment help prevent complications. The duration of jaundice varies among babies, with breastfed infants possibly experiencing it for a longer time compared to formula-fed babies. Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider ensures timely intervention if needed."

The impact of vaccines, including the tetanus vaccine, has been substantial in reducing the incidence of such diseases.

        "answers": [
            "Understand it as well as possible and then be supportive of treatments. This FAQ's might help you. 1. What is bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder is a common, recurrent, severe psychiatric illness that affects an individual's mood, behavior and ability to think clearly. It occurs in 1% to 2% of the population in the United States. A variant, called bipolar II disorder, is probably even more common and occurs in up to 3% of the general population in this country. 2. What are the differences between bipolar I and bipolar II disorders? Bipolar I disorder is characterized by episodes of mania that alternate with periods of depression or periods in which individuals have simultaneously occurring manic and depressive symptoms called mixed states. In contrast, bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and milder symptoms of mania, called hypomania. Hypomanic episodes typically do not impair an individual's ability to function to the extent that full-blown manic episodes do additionally; hypomanic episodes are not complicated by psychotic symptoms. 3. What is rapid cycling? The term rapid cycling was originally coined by David Dunner, M.D., and Ron Fieve, M.D., in the 1970s when they identified a group of individuals who did not respond well to lithium. These patients typically had four or more episodes of mania or depression in the 12-month interval prior to lithium treatment. This definition has been adopted formally by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.) and specifically means the occurrence of four or more mood episodes within the preceding year. In severe cases, rapid cycling can occur even within a one-day period. 4. At what age does bipolar disorder appear? Bipolar disorder most commonly presents in the late teens and early 20s. Unfortunately, for most individuals, lifelong treatment may be required to prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Equally unfortunate is evidence that the illness often goes undiagnosed and untreated for many years; the longer the illness progresses without treatment, the greater the impairment in an individual's psychological, educational and vocational development. Additionally, untreated bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. 5. Is bipolar disorder genetic? Bipolar disorder, among all psychiatric illnesses, may have the greatest genetic contribution. For instance, if an individual has a parent with bipolar disorder, the chance that the individual's child will have bipolar disorder is about nine-fold greater than in the general population, with the risk rising from about 1% to about 10%. The inheritability of this illness is estimated to be anywhere from 50% to 80%. On the other hand, if a person with bipolar disorder is thinking about having children, there are still good odds that the child will not have bipolar illness. So the genetic determinants of the illness are complicated. 6. How is bipolar disorder treated? The cornerstone of treatment is medications that treat acute manic, depressive or mixed episodes, and which, in the long run, attempt to prevent the recurrence of these episodes. Such medications include lithium, divalproex (Depakote) and, more recently, some of the atypical antipsychotics as well as antidepressants. Psychotherapy plays an important role in improving the course and outcome of this illness in people. In particular, those with bipolar disorder often have strained relationships with loved ones because of their experiences during manic or depressive episodes; psychotherapy can help repair these torn relationships. In addition, psychotherapy can educate people about the signs and symptoms of their illness, how to pay attention to warning signs and how to nip emerging episodes in the bud. Psychotherapy can also help individuals cope with the stress that can sometimes precipitate manic or depressive episodes. 7. What med",

Rapid cycling, involving four or more mood episodes within a year, adds complexity to the disorder. Onset typically occurs in late teens or early 20s, and genetic factors contribute significantly. Treatment involves medications for acute episodes and long-term prevention, along with psychotherapy to enhance coping strategies and relationship dynamics.

        "question": "what is Fifth Disease?",
        "answers": [
            "It is a infectious disease-mostly kids get--with a rash on feet, hands and mouth--it goes away in about 14 days--no big deal",
            "What is \"fifth disease?\" Fifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days. What causes fifth disease? Fifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child. Can adults get fifth disease? Yes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease. Is fifth disease contagious? Yes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash. How does someone get infected with parvovirus B19? Parvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease. How soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill? A susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection. Does everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill? No. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future. How is fifth disease diagnosed? A physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection. Is fifth disease serious? Fifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability. Parvovirus B19 infection may cause a serious"

            "A hiccup or hiccough (generally pronounced \"hiccup\" independent of the spelling) is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm; typically this repeats several times a minute. The sudden rush of air into the lungs causes the glottis to close, creating the \"hic\" noise. A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term \"hiccup\" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus. While many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors.",
            "Irrition to your diaphragm causes hiccups. The diaphragn pulls down when yoyou inhale to help pull air into the lungs, and it pushes up when yoyou exhale to help push air out of the lungs. But when your diaphragm gets irritated it pushes up in a jerky way causing a hiccup.",
            "Hiccups are sudden, involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle.

While hiccups often resolve on their own, various home remedies exist to expedite their cessation, and in some cases, medication may be required. The term \"hiccup\" is also metaphorically used to describe minor deviations in an otherwise consistent pattern. These spasms can be triggered by diverse factors such as eating too quickly, consuming hot or spicy foods, laughing vigorously, or drinking excessively. Hiccups may also arise from anatomical pressure on the phrenic nerve or, rarely, due to tumors. Irritation to the diaphragm, a muscle aiding in breathing, is the underlying cause of hiccups. When irritated, the diaphragm contracts involuntarily, causing the vocal cords to snap shut and produce the hiccup sound.

Most of the time, although not always, leukemia affects the white blood cells. The disease starts in the bone marrow before spreading to other parts of the body. Leukemia is generally described as either acute leukemia (fast-growing) or chronic leukemia (slower-growing). The latter type of leukemia is most often found in children."

Leukemia primarily involves the white blood cells and originates in the bone marrow, spreading to other parts of the body.

            "I could answer this several different ways. Peter Breggin is the author of \"Talking back to Prozac\" and \"Toxic Psychiatry\". David Healy is anti-drug but pro-ECT (electroconvulsive therapy which 'treats' bipolar and depression). Dr. John Burrows has his own podcast, in which he says that benzos are \"evil\" or very close to it. So clearly, there are some 'good' psychiatrists not necessarily corrupted by the pharmecuetical company. My brief scan of the research on Google Scholar, searching for \"psychiatric ward culture\" indicates that psychiatrists rely on an authoritation methedology -- do what I say without asking why. I also think that little is known about the antipsychotics. My father, a biochemist, calls them \"blunt instruments\" and they are. I counsel people to stick to the least-invasive remedy. (ie. mood stabilizers for bipolar rather than antipsychotics (also called neuroleptics.) Peter Breggin has an entire essay at http://www.breggin.com on why their use should be limited. I would get a second opinion from ancupunturists, cranial-sacral massage therapists (mine helped me a lot, although was not around like my psychiatrist was), and even a good alternative pharmacy if yoyou have one in your area. I had a manic episode, and found a Total Omega-3 supplement (fish-based) to really improve at least my own sense of health. There is scientific evidence emerging that Omega-3 helps with depression and possibly bipolar. I could rant on and on on this topic. But if yoyou go to my portal at http://health.wikispaces.com and register yoyou will get access to all my thoughts as they evolve. (Think of it as a blog where I am encouraging other people to research and contribute.)",

Doctors also have to deal with confused patients who read about new drugs in magazines see new drugs on television and are being market new drugs in commercials and advertising. At the other end of the spectrum yoyou have the real lack of psychiatric care under the American Health Insurance Industry. So there yoyou have it: we are left with bills and pills to solve everything.",

Sigmund Freud took them into the \"dark abyss\" of \"Analysis\" and today they have cleaned themselves up, put on nice clothes, will \"cheerfully\" give yoyou 10 to 15 minutes of their \"holier than thou\" time, charge yoyou a fortune for Evaluation and Management (E & M) and dispense inummerable combinations and complexities of \"pharmacologic agents.\" Experience? Yes. From great suffering comes great compassion -- I have battled clinical depression for over 30 years now -- and have much experience with these \"men (and women) of medicine.\" If there were as many good dentists as there are psychiatrists, no one in America would have any teeth...

            "I personally was diagnosed with one a few years ago was sent to a cardiologist who said it was nothing to worry about it. Since then, it was not detected when I had physicals. I know many people who were diagnosed with them and they were nothing. Here's some info from webmd: In particular, they occur in many healthy children, who may or may not outgrow them as adults. They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes. Though many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery. Within the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart. A healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves. Heart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer yoyou to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that yoyou take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when yoyou have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur. Symptoms Many people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms: * Chest pain * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations) * Breathlessness * Fatigue * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects)",

The heart murmur is an extra sound, like a whooshing, caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.

Symptoms may include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, fatigue, and bluish skin color in some cases. A heart murmur could also be associated with a hole in the heart.

There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.

        "labelled_summary": "Bipolar disorder is explained as a chemical imbalance in the brain, with various life factors contributing to episodes, such as stress, sleep patterns, and alcohol consumption. The environment, especially a strong support system, plays a crucial role. The idea is raised that overcoming challenges may involve learning to manage them rather than completely getting over them. The permanence of neural pathways is acknowledged, suggesting that faults or challenges are integral to one's identity. The concept of creating new, positive neural pathways is proposed as a means of coping and leading a fulfilling life. The ability to manage bipolar disorder depends on its type, impact on daily life, and other factors, with various therapies available for support. The message encourages focusing on building positive paths that lead toward desired destinations."

        "question": "What is the best cure for endometriosis?",
        "answers": [
            "There is no cure for endometriosis. But there are many treatments, each of which has pros and cons. It is important to build a good relationship with your doctor, so yoyou can decide what option is best for you. Pain Medication For some women with mild symptoms, no further treatment other than medication for pain may be needed. For women with minimal endometriosis who want to become pregnant, doctors are saying that, depending on the age of the woman and her amount of pain from the disease, the best thing to do is to have a trial period of unprotected sex for six months to one year. If she does not get pregnant in that time, then further treatment may be needed. Hormone Treatment For patients who do not wish to become pregnant, but need treatment for their disease, their doctors may suggest hormone treatment. Hormone treatment is most effective when growths are small. Hormones can come in pill form, by shot or injection, or in a nasal spray. There are several hormones used for this treatment including a combination of estrogen and progestin such as birth control pills, a progestin alone, Danocrine (a weak male hormone), and GnRH agonists (gonadotropin releasing hormone). Birth control pills control the growth of the tissue that lines the uterus and often decrease the amount of menstrual flow. They usually contain two hormones, estrogen and progestin. Once a woman stops taking them, the ability to become pregnant returns, but the symptoms of endometriosis also may return. Some women take birth control pills continuously, without using the sugar pills that signal the body to go through menstruation. When birth control pills are taken in this way, the menstrual period may stop altogether, which can reduce pain or get rid of it entirely. Some birth control pills contain only progestin, a progesterone-like hormone. Women who can't take estrogen use these pills to reduce menstrual flow. With these pills, some women may not have pain for several years after stopping treatment. All birth control pills might cause some mild side effects like weight gain, bleeding between periods, and bloating. Danocrine has become a more common treatment choice than either progestin or combination hormone pills. Side effects with Danocrine include oily skin, pimples or acne, weight gain, muscle cramps, tiredness, smaller breasts, breast tenderness, headaches, dizziness, weakness, hot flashes, or a deepening of the voice. Women on Danocrine probably will only get a period now and then, or might not get it at all. Women who take Danocrine also should take steps to prevent pregnancy because it can harm a baby growing in the uterus. Because other hormones, like birth control pills, should be avoided, health care providers recommend that yoyou use condoms, a diaphragm, or other \"barrier\" methods to prevent pregnancy. GnRH agonists (used daily in a nose spray, or as an injection given once a month or every three months) prevent the body from making certain hormones to prevent menstruation. Without menstruation, the growth of endometriosis is slowed or stopped. These medications can cause side effects, such as hot flashes, tiredness, problems sleeping, headaches, depression, bone loss, and vaginal dryness. Most health care providers recommend that a woman stay on a GnRH agonist for about six months. After that time, the body will start having a period again and a woman could get pregnant. But, after that time, about half of women have some return of their endometriosis symptoms. Surgery Surgery is usually the best choice for women with extensive endometriosis, or those with severe pain. There are both minor and major surgeries that can help. Your doctor might suggest one of the following surgical treatments: Laparoscopy - also used to diagnose the disease, your doctor can treat yoyou with this surgery as well. If your doctor is going to treat the endometriosis during this surgery, he or she must make at least tw",

Yoyou can also have surgery to remove them but they'll just come back. See a Reproductive Endocrinologist and try to get pregnant. If yoyou wait too long for pregnancy it may not happen. Stay hopeful and prayerful.",

The BEST decision is the one that is best for the individual, and is decided between her and her doctor.",
            "First let me start off by saying that PREGNANCY DOES NOT CURE ENDO FOR ALL WOMEN, in fact for some women, their endo comes back after getting pregnant and others are not ready to get pregnant. I was diagnosed with endometriosis back when i was 13, and believe me, i wish there was a magical cure. I did a Distinguished Achievement Program project on endo in high school last year and researched various treatments. So far, the treatment that i have found works best for many women are using alternative treatments such as nutritional approaches. Many women have found relief by eating better such as ORGANIC FOODS, HERBAL REMEDIES, and lots of stress reducing exercise, such as yoga, meditation or even just running. The best thing to do is to research as much as yoyou can. That is what helped me the most. It made me feel more in control of my endo. Different treatments work diversely for different women, work with your doctor and your own research to find out what works best for you, whether it be by medical, surgical, or alternative treatments.

Building a strong doctor-patient relationship is essential for deciding the most suitable option. Pain medication may be sufficient for those with mild symptoms, while women with minimal endometriosis aspiring to become pregnant might opt for a trial period of unprotected sex. Hormone treatments, including birth control pills, progestin, Danocrine, or GnRH agonists, are suggested for those not aiming for pregnancy, but their effectiveness varies. Surgery, such as laparoscopy, is recommended for extensive or severe cases. Hysterectomy may be considered in severe cases when other treatments fail and fertility is no longer desired. The choice of treatment is highly individual, necessitating collaborative decision-making between the patient and her doctor, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It's important to note that pregnancy does not universally cure endometriosis, and various treatments should be explored based on individual circumstances and preferences."

            "Some of the more common operations that gynaecologists perform include: termination of pregnancy dilation and curettage (removal of the uterine contents, for various reasons, including miscarriage and menorrhagia; procedurally very similar to the above); hysterectomy (removal of the uterus); oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries); tubal ligation; Exploratory laporoscopy or laporotomy (used to diagnose and treat sources of pelvic and abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, vaginal bleeding, etc.) colposuspension ('tightening' of the ligaments around the vagina, a common therapy for incontinence and discomfort in older women); Large Loop Excision of the Transition Zone (LLETZ), where the surface of the cervix, containing pre-cancerous cells identified on Pap smear are removed).",
            "Gynaecology is a typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option. As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination. Investigations Some of the investigations used in gynaecology are: abdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. vaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. blood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. hysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. laparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. MRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle. Diseases The main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are: cancer of the cervix. The Papanicolaoyou (Pap) smear is a means of detecting this, by obtaining a sample of cervical epithelial cells and examining them under a microscope for malignant changes. All women are encouraged to have pap smears at regular intervals after commencing intercourse. incontinence of urine. amenorrhoea (absent periods) dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) infertility menorrhagia (heavy periods). This is a main indication for hysterectomy. prolapse Obviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist.",

        "question": "what is a trans sexual???",
        "answers": [
            "A transsexual is an individual who plans to have or who has had SRS (sexual reassignment surgery) or hormone therapy. Contrary to popular belief they don't all want to transition b/c they're a man trapped in a woman's body, or a woman trapped in a man's body. Nor does everyone know from a very young age that they want to transition and not every transsexual hates the body they were born with. There are complicated reasons other than that related to an individual's desire to transition. Transsexuals can be heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, or any other sexuality. Eventually however their bodies will reflect their gender with the help of the methods listed above and this new body is different from the sexed term assigned to the body and the person at birth.",
            "I just want to clear up some misconceptions here: A transsexual is a person who self-identifies as a person of the opposite sex from what they were born as. Both male-to-female and female-to-male transexuals exist, but MTF is more common. It takes hormone therapy and surgery to completely change one's sex. People who choose to undergo the transistion are often required to live with their new identity for a year before doctors will allow any surgery to be done. People who have not had the surgery are called pre-op transexuals, as opposed to post-op. Transexuality actually has nothing to do with who the person is sexually attracted to, only the sexual identity of the person. This is probably the hardest thing to grasp for non-transexuals as our sexual preference is the most over-riding part of our sexuality. What Dr. Dee refers to is a pre-op transexual. They normally can't \"play a man\", as the breast tissue has already increased to a size that would require disguise to revert back. However, people can be born as hermaphrodites (people with both male and female sexual parts). Often when this occurs, the doctor doing the delivery will arbitrarily assign gender - sometimes not even informing the parents.",

So pretty much when a guy or girl wants to change their sexual preference they are transexual. Heterosexual- Attracted to opposite sex Homosexual- Attracted to the same sex Trassexual- When sexual identity is changed . bisexual- Attracted to both same and opposite sex. Asexual- Don't like sex at all. Then there is another one where a guy would wanna stick it in anything and a girl would want anything stuck in her but i don't know the exact term for that."

This is why the left ventricle - the chamber that pumps freshly oxygenated blood out of the heart - is usually the location of most thickening. Since this is a progressive disease, there can sometimes be no symptoms at all. However, as the disease progresses, the thickened walls leave less room for blood in the chambers. This can lead to distinct signs of abnormal heart function, which include breathlessness, angina (chest pain), syncope (fainting) after strenous exercise, pounding heartbeat, or fatigue. The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is complicated with the condition left ventricular hypertrophy - which is an enlarging of the left ventricle. This is common in athletic people, due to heightened conditioning. However, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be properly diagnosed with an ECG and chest x-ray.

HIV is entered through the body through the mucous membranes or thryou blood to blood contact. Once yoyou get the virus it slowly begins to attack the immune system, killing off healthy immune system cells. The deterioration and destruction of immune function leads to AIDS. AIDS is the final stage of the HIV infection. A person is said to have AIDS when the cd4 counts drops below 200 and or a person has 1 or more opportunistic infections. The OIs, as they are called, are normal infections that a healthy person would be able to fight off. The four stages of the HIV infection are as follows: 1) The period following infection is called the window. It is called this because it reflect the window of time between infection and that which antibodies are devlop in a person. The HIV test looks for antibodies not the virus. 2) The second stage is called seroconversion. This is when the body begins to develop lots of antibodies to fight off the virus in the body. During this period a person may have flyou like sympton. Also during this period is said to be very infectious. 3) The third stage is called symptom free. During this period a person may have no sympton what so ever. This can last any where from 6 months to well over ten years. The medical world is not sure why some people are living sympton free for so long. 4) The final stage is called AIDS. This is the period when TCELL drop to below 200 and the OI\"S are present. So, as we see, HIV is a infection that will leads to AIDS. The body immune system is slowly being attacked until it is destroyed and can't fight off infections.

HIV or Human Immunodeficiency Virus is a retrovirus that causes AIDS by affecting the very immune system cells (T4 lymphocytes) that would ordinarily fight off such a viral infection. HIV is not transmitted by casual contact; transmission requires a direct exchange of body fluids, such as blood or blood products, breast milk, semen, or vaginal secretions, most commonly as a result of sexual activity or the sharing of needles among drug users. Such a transmission may also occur from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth. Saliva, tears, urine, feces, and sweat do not appear to transmit the virus.",

In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body.\"",

            "Causes of HIV/AIDS Cause of HIV/AIDS: AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By killing or damaging cells of the body's immune system, HIV progressively destroys the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers. People diagnosed with AIDS may get life-threatening diseases called opportunistic infections, which are caused by microbes such as viruses or bacteria that usually do not make healthy people sick. 1 Cause statistics for HIV/AIDS: The following are statistics from various sources about the causes of HIV/AIDS: 57.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through sex with other men in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 24% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 9.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 38% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 59% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) Cause details for HIV/AIDS: HIV disease is characterized by a gradual deterioration of immune function. Most notably, crucial immune cells called CD4+ T cells are disabled and killed during the typical course of infection. These cells, sometimes called \"T-helper cells,\" play a central role in the immune response, signaling other cells in the immune system to perform their special functions. A healthy, uninfected person usually has 800 to 1,200 CD4+ T cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood. During HIV infection, the number of these cells in a person's blood progressively declines. When a person's CD4+ T cell count falls below 200/mm3, he or she becomes particularly vulnerable to the opportunistic infections and cancers that typify AIDS, the end stage of HIV disease. People with AIDS often suffer infections of the lungs, intestinal tract, brain, eyes and other organs, as well as debilitating weight loss, diarrhea, neurologic conditions and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and certain types of lymphomas. Most scientists think that HIV causes AIDS by directly inducing the death of CD4+ T cells or interfering with their normal function, and by triggering other events that weaken a person's immune function. For example, the network of signaling molecules that normally regulates a person's immune response is disrupted during HIV disease, impairing a person's ability to fight other infections. The HIV-mediated destruction of the lymph nodes and related immunologic organs also plays a major role in causing the immunosuppression seen in people with AIDS.

        "answers": [
            "Working out the same muscle group every day just makes the muscle larger or blukier. Tissue are packed into highly arranged bundles. When yoyou work out yoyou are actually contracting and relaxing the tissue that makes up the muscle. As yoyou move your muscle some of the tissue break down causing the pain and friction. Resting a day between working out just gives time for the muscle to repair the broken down tissue. The benefit is that since some of the tissue had broken down when yoyou work out the next day yoyou rely on other tissue that has not broken down in the muscle group to raise the weight that yoyou are raising. The muscle will eventually get bulkier if yoyou do it that way and it will be pretty painful because the tissue will eventually be broken down. Doctors don't usually recommend yoyou to work out the same muscle group every day because they believe that the muscle should be fully repaired before yoyou work out.",
            "In the Army, they would have us do an Easy Day, then a Hard Day. Easy Day was basic warm-up followed by soccer or whatever. Hard Day was warm-up followed by multiple mile run, workout in the gym, whatever. They feel that it is required. As for the muscle burn, that happens because yoyou are burning the muscle and fat, to my understanding. Depending on whether yoyou are trying to build-up your muscles, gain tone, or lose weight, yoyou will get different effects for different types of workouts.",
            "yes, yoyou are suppose to work a different muscle group everyday. Because yoyou don't want your muscles to get used to the same thing everyday then it becomes routine your body will be so used it that it will not burn fat and build muscle as much as it would if yoyou change it up everyday. If yoyou don't feel burn after your exercise yoyou could be doing them wrong yoyou should feel some burn.",
            "I workout twice a day everyday, and there are days when i will work out my arms in the morning and then come home and workout my arms again in the evening. they say yoyou should work out your muscles as much as possible for they burn the most calories. Also, about the burn in your muscles, i don't feel the burn all the time, but i can guarantee if you, if yoyou are doing the exercise right, then yoyou will see results within 6 weeks.",
            "It is always best to rotate the muscles yoyou excersize. Reason is that yoyou do not want to end up 'muscle heavy', IE:If yoyou only work one set of muscles, let's say in your arms, yoyou will have tremendous arms, and not tremendous anything else. Once the burn leaves, yoyou are keeping them fit, but not adding to the bulk of the muscle. hope this helps",
            "Ding! What winnie said. All yoyou are doing working the same muscles every day is damaging them, yoyou get a much better benefit if yoyou rest them and allow the muscle to heal. And that \"if yoyou do not feel the burn\" is the old philosophy of \"No paing, no gain\" which is basically now to be considered a load of horse crap."
        ],
        "labelled_summary": "Working out the same muscle group every day can lead to muscle enlargement or bulkiness as tissues are densely packed in organized bundles. During exercise, the muscle tissues contract and relax, causing some breakdown and resulting in pain and friction. Resting a day between workouts allows for the repair of the broken-down tissues. This rest is essential as it forces reliance on unaffected tissues in the muscle group during subsequent workouts, contributing to muscle development. Doctors typically advise against daily workouts for the same muscle group, emphasizing the need for full muscle recovery before exercising again. In the military, the practice of alternating between Easy Days and Hard Days is common, allowing for adequate recovery. Muscle burn during exercise is believed to be a result of burning both muscle and fat, with different workout types producing varied effects on muscle building, toning, or weight loss. Rotating muscle groups in workouts is recommended to prevent the body from adapting to a routine, promoting effective fat burning and muscle development. Feeling a burn during exercise is considered normal, indicating that the workout is targeting the muscles correctly. It's advised to rotate exercises to avoid becoming 'muscle heavy' in one area and to allow muscles to heal and grow effectively. Simply working the same muscles every day can lead to damage without maximizing the benefits that come from rest and recovery."

Fatigue can be a normal and important response to physical exertion, emotional stress, boredom, or lack of sleep. However, it can also be a nonspecific sign of a more serious psychological or physical disorder. Fatigue that is not relieved by enough sleep, good nutrition, or a low-stress environment should be evaluated by your doctor. Because fatigue is a common complaint, sometimes a potentially serious cause may be overlooked. The pattern of fatigue may help your doctor determine its underlying cause. For example, if yoyou wake up in the morning rested but rapidly develop fatigue with activity, yoyou may have an ongoing physical condition like an underactive thyroid. On the other hand, if yoyou wake up with a low level of energy and have fatigue that lasts throughout the day, yoyou may be depressed. ======================== Do yoyou have any underlying illnesses?

If your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that yoyou have had bone loss which is usually caused by periodontal disease (an infection in the gums). The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly (brush at least twice a day for two minutes). I emphasize flossing, because often people don't realize just how important it is. The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck, and therefore where bacteria sticks most often, too. The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch. So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth, yoyou want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure yoyou remove the plaque. So yoyou should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact. Hope this helps!"

And then there's genetics. If there are a lot of heavier people in her family then chances are she's gonna be heavier too no matter what she does. And then her metabolism also plays a factor. If her metabolism is slow then she's just gonna be heavier. But if she's only 5 feet tall then hopefully she's not TOO heavy. Because that could cause heart problems for her. But since she's twelve she's still growing so it may balance out for her."

The aim of reiki is to promote health, maintain well-being, and help people attain a higher consciousness. Practitioners draw on \"reiki energy\" channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients. They borrow terminology from physics, claiming that reiki acts at an atomic level, causing the body's molecules to vibrate with higher intensity and thus dissolving energy blockages that lead to disharmony and disease. A treatment session lasts about an hour; the practitioner directs reike energy through his hands to the patient. The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each. This is said to balance the body's energy centers or \"chakras.\" Some patients may feel relaxed after treatment; others feel invigorated.\" To get in touch with your own energy body as a beginner, I recommend T'ai Chi.

They may appear to be \"crossed\" or one may seem to drift inward, outward, or upward. Strabismus can be constant (meaning the eyes are always crossed or misaligned) or intermittent (meaning it happens now and then). What is amblyopia? Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) develops when the brain shuts off or suppresses vision in one eye. This can happen if your baby's eyes are misaligned or if he can't see as well with one eye because of nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or something that's blocking clear vision in that eye, like a cataract or a drooping eyelid. About 3 to 6 percent of children under the age of 6 develop amblyopia.

Unfortunately, most of us combat this fatigue with \u201cartificial\u201d energy products (stimulants) that give a temporary boost but leave us more exhausted afterwards. Fatigue is the feeling of extreme tiredness or loss of energy due to physical strain, mental strain, or illness. Typically, fatigue is easily remedied through additional rest and relaxation. However, extreme or chronic fatigue is a more serious form of fatigue that can be caused by one of a number of diseases. Among these fatigue-causing illnesses are chronic fatique syndrome, diabetes, depression, and more. If yoyou always feel tired and suspect some abnormal underlying cause, consider seeing a doctor when convenient. General fatigue can affect your daily life as well as those people who surround yoyou and should be taken seriously. Difficulty getting restful sleep or constant fatigue during the day can be helped with natural remedies in addition to certain medications. Fatigue medications should be prescribed by a trained health care practitioner. Herbal medicines, natural therapies, and other alternative means can be explored more freely, but not all remedies are guaranteed to work for every person.

Fatigue can be caused by anemia or associated with major organ dysfunction, including severe heart or lung disease, kidney failure, or liver failure. Hypothyroidism (insufficient production of thyroid hormone) and adrenal problems, even if mild, can cause fatigue. Neuromuscular disorders, malnutrition, infection, dehydration or electrolyte disturbances can also be associated with fatigue, as well as sleep disorders, immobility and lack of exercise, chronic pain, or the use of centrally-acting drugs (e.g., opioids). Psychosocial factors associated with fatigue are anxiety and depression, stress, and those related to the reactions of others to the fatigue.",

            "There are several types of leukemia. They are grouped in two ways. One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected. Leukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually. Leukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia. These are the most common types of leukemia: 1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. 2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). 3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. 4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. 5.Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. This and other uncommon types of leukemia are not discussed here.

        "question": "Can drinking to many diet cokes cause an ulcer?",
        "answers": [
            "It sure can - read this... it tells yoyou what else can cause ulcers and explains what an ulcer is. My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!): An ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. There are two main types of ulcers- Peptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. How do yoyou know if yoyou have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. Intense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. There may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. There are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. Some medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. Tense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. Although uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. When a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. If yoyou find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. The above is provided for your information, but yoyou are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems. Our information is not medical advice. Yoyou must see your own doctor for medical advice about your gastro esophageal or ulcers.",

If yoyou pay attention you'll notice that when using Aspartame/Nutrasweet, everything yoyou eat at the same time also tastes sweet! This may be why Aspartame/Nutrasweet causes yoyou to crave carbohydrates. Hence, yoyou won't lose weight using it. BTW, cyclamates got pulled off the market in the 70's in the US (but not Canada or the rest of the world) because the sugar industry saw too much of their market disappear. # Aspartame/Nutrasweet (aspartylphenylalanine-methyl-ester) breaks down to its poison constituents at 86 degrees (Aspartic Acid 40%, Phenylalanine 50%, and Methanol 10%). Remember your stomach is at 98.6 degrees! Therefore yoyou should never use Aspartame/Nutrasweet in hot beverages or cooked foods such as Jello. How the FDA allows this remains a mystery. There is mounting evidence that the \"Burning Mouth Syndrome\" experienced by the Desert Storm troops was actually Methanol poisoning from the Diet Coke they drank lots of, after being exposed to desert temperatures. # Aspartame/Nutrasweet's 10% Methanol appears in the body quickly and is the same alcohol (wood alcohol also in lacquer thinner), that your mother correctly warned yoyou could make yoyou blind. Many skid-row alcoholics had major problems with this cheap but deadly form of alcohol. # Aspartame/Nutrasweet's 40% Aspartic Acid is an \"excitotoxin\" in the brain and excites neurons to death, i.e. it kills brain cells and causes other nerve damage. # Aspartame/Nutrasweet triggers Migraine Headaches This even happened to me!. The Usenet is filled with posts by people who have pinned their migraines down to aspartame/Nutrasweet consumption. # Aspartame/Nutrasweet's breakdown products attack the bodies tissues and create Formaldehyde which builds up in the tissues forever. Remember the smelly, eye watering fumes from the frogs yoyou dissected in school? They were preserved with Formaldehyde! Formaldehyde is thought to cause cancer. The American Bottlers Association did not want the FDA to approve Aspartame/Nutrasweet because of what the test report showed. But the FDA approved it anyway! # Airline pilots stay away from Aspartame/Nutrasweet because they are well aware of the documented dangers. # Aspartame/Nutrasweet also breaks down to diketopiperazine [DKP] which is proven to cause Brain Tumors! Brain Tumors used to be rare. Several of the rats in the original study formed brain tumors during their Aspartame/Nutrasweet exposure. The researchers surgically removed the tumors and returned the rats to the study and discounted the tumors",

There are also variations between groups within single countries. For example, in the US in the early 20th century there were very large differences in life expectancy between people of different races, which have since lessened. There remain significant differences in life expectancy between men and women in the US and other developed countries, with women outliving men. These differences by sex have been reducing in recent years, with men's life expectancy improving at a faster rate than women's. Poverty and inequality has a very substantial effect on life expectancy. In the United Kingdom life expectancy in the wealthiest areas is ten years longer than the poorest areas and the gap appears to be increasing as life expectancy for the prosperous continues to increase while in more deprived communities there is little increase. (Department of Health -[Tackling health inequalities]: Status report on the Programme for Action Air pollution may also reduce life expectancy, especially for those living near busy roads, due to the exhaust fumes from cars. Occupation may also have a major effect on life expectancy. Well-educated professionals working in offices have a high life expectancy, while asbestos and coal miners do not.

Currently, in the Western world, the average lifespan is around 77-81 years. Life expectancy worldwide varies due to differences in public health, medicine, and nutrition among countries. Intra-country variations exist, such as racial differences in the early 20th century United States, which have since reduced. Disparities persist between genders, with women generally outliving men, though this gap is narrowing. Socioeconomic factors, air pollution, occupation, genetic disorders, and drug use also influence life expectancy, emphasizing the impact of broader social, environmental, and individual factors on human longevity. In the United Kingdom, there is a notable gap in life expectancy between the wealthiest and poorest areas, influenced by factors like poverty and inequality.

        "answers": [
            "The oxygen dissociation curve is a graph that shows the percent saturation of hemoglobin at various partial pressures of oxygen. Commonly a curve may be expressed with the P50 value. This is a value which tells the pressure at which the erythrocytes are fifty percent saturated with oxygen. (Bouverot, 1985). The purpose of an oxygen dissociation curve is to show the equilibrium of oxyhemoglobin and nonbonded hemoglobin at various partial pressures (Oxygen Dissociation Curve). At high partial pressures of oxygen, usually in the lungs, hemoglobin binds to oxygen to form oxyhemoglobin. When the blood is fully saturated all the erythrocytes are in the form of oxyhemoglobin. As the erythrocytes travel to tissues deprived of oxygen the partial pressure of oxygen will decrease. Consequently, the oxyhemoglobin releases the oxygen to form hemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997). The sigmoid shape of the oxygen dissociation curve is a result of the cooperative binding of oxygen to the four polypeptide chains. Cooperative binding is the characteristic of a hemoglobin to have a greater ability to bind oxygen after a subunit has bound oxygen (Oxygen Dissociation Curve). Thus, hemoglobin is most attracted to oxygen when three of the four polypeptide chains are bound to oxygen. Factors that Influence Oxygen Binding * Temperature- Increasing the temperature denatures the bond between oxygen and hemoglobin, which increases the amount of oxygen and hemoglobin and decreases the concentration of oxyhemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997). The dissociation curve shifts to the right. * pH- A decrease in pH (increase in acidity) by addition of carbon dioxide or other acids causes a Bohr Shift. A Bohr. shift is characterized by causing more oxygen to be given up as oxygen pressure increases and it is more pronounced in animals of smaller size due to the increase in sensitivity to acid (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997). The dissociation curve shifts to the right. * Organic Phospates- 2,3-Diphosphoglycerated (DPG) is the primary organic phosphate in mammals. DPG binds to hemoglobin which rearranges the hemoglobin into the T-state, thus decreasing the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin (T and R State). The curve shifts to the right.",
            "The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is an important tool for understanding how our blood carries and releases oxygen. Specifically, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve relates oxygen saturation (SO2) and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2), and is determined by what is called \"hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen,\" that is, how readily hemoglobin acquires and releases oxygen molecules from its surrounding tissue.",

A key indicator, the P50 value, signifies the pressure at which half the red blood cells are saturated with oxygen. In the lungs, where oxygen levels are high, hemoglobin forms oxyhemoglobin. During circulation to oxygen-deprived tissues, the curve shows how oxyhemoglobin releases oxygen. The curve's sigmoid shape results from cooperative binding, enhancing oxygen affinity. Factors influencing binding include temperature, pH (Bohr Shift), and organic phosphates like 2,3-DPG, which decrease oxygen affinity, causing the curve to shift to the right. Understanding this curve is crucial for comprehending how our blood effectively carries and releases oxygen."

            "Yoyou have several options to treat your Vertigo. Because Vertigo is not a disease, Vertigo treatment and Vertigo remedies depend upon diagnosing the underlying cause. Once the cause is identified, doctors may choose from among these Vertigo treatment options: Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a physical therapy-based Vertigo treatment. It is designed to reduce the effects of Vertigo symptoms by introducing the patient to a series of exercises for Vertigo. Successful Vertigo treatment using this method is said to improve balance and prevent falls by helping to restore functionality to the vestibular system. VRT is not always successful. Major considerations that must be addressed when deciding upon this particular Vertigo treatment include: The patient's age The ability of the patient to remember and follow directions. The general physical and mental health of the patient The patient's physical strength Vertigo Medication If the underlying causes of Vertigo are diagnosed to be an ear infections that is caused by the presence of bacteria, the the doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. The problem with taking these types of antibiotics, other than the expense of the prescription, is that they have produced side effects in many people including allergic reaction like shortness of breath; throat closure; hives; facial, lips and tongue swelling, seizures, severe watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some patients have even reported unusual bleeding. A type of Vertigo known as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, which is believed to be caused by a calcium buildup in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, is frequently treated with a drug called meclizine or Antivert. Side effects of this Vertigo medication may include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision. When meclizine does not work, the doctor will try certain benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, or antihistamines such as promethazine. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, and tremors. Vertigo Surgery If the Vertigo symptoms are caused by an ear infection, and those infections become chronic, the doctor may opt to perform a surgical procedure whereby an incision is made in the eardrum and a small tube is placed in the incision which prevents fluid and bacteria from building up inside of the ear.

It is estimated that it affects about 1 to 2 in 100,000 people. It occurs when the adrenal glands, seated above the kidneys, fail to produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, sometimes, the hormone aldosterone. Addison's disease refers specifically to primary adrenal insufficiency, in which the adrenal glands themselves malfunction; secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland does not produce enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to adequately stimulate the adrenal glands.",

The disease is characterized by weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and sometimes darkening of the skin in both exposed and nonexposed parts of the body.

            "Fexofenadine is an oral, \"second generation\" antihistamine that is used to treat the signs and symptoms of allergy that are due to histamine. It is similar to the other second generation antihistamines loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec) and azelastine (Astelin). Histamine is a chemical that is responsible for many of the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions, for example, swelling of the lining of the nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. Histamine is released from histamine-storing cells (mast cells) and then attaches to other cells that have receptors for histamine. The attachment of the histamine to the receptors causes the cell to be \"activated,\" releasing other chemicals that produce the effects that we associate with allergy, e.g., sneezing. Fexofenadine blocks one type of receptor for histamine (the H1 receptor) and thus prevents activation of H1 receptor-containing cells by histamine. Unlike the first generation antihistamines, fexofenadine and other second-generation antihistamines do not readily enter the brain from the blood, and, therefore, they cause less drowsiness. Fexofenadine was approved by the FDA in July, 1995."

            "The skin of your finger consists of tiny little skin cells, 100's and 100's of millions of them. Each cell is so small yoyou would need a powerful microscope for looking at 100 of them. All cells are surrounded by a membrane. Somewhat like a very, very tiny balloon filled with salty jello. The insides of the outermost cells are salty and dehydrated because your skin grows from underneath, the dermis, close to the capillaries (blood supply). The outer skin, called the epidermis, consists of cells which are wearing out and drying up, although they are mostly not quite dead yet. The very oldest ones that are dead come off when yoyou scrub or shower. Some are falling off all the time, but they are so small yoyou do not see them. Since the epidermis consists of rather dry cells, it is able to absorb water. The cell walls allow the water in your tub, shower, or pool to penetrate into each cell. The insides, being salty, are have a strong affinity for water. If yoyou spend a long time in the water, the epidermal cells swell up, increasing in size, somewhat like the the balloons mentioned earlier being filled with more water. When the skin on the outside of your hands or toes swells it has more surface area than previously. Instead of being like a tight fitting glove, it becomes more like a glove that is too big. If yoyou put on a glove that is too big, it will have wrinkles instead of being stretched smoothly. The entry of water into a cell is called osmosis. If yoyou stay in fresh water for an extremely long time, many cells will absorb so much water they will burst. That is called lysis. Red blood cells are much more fragile than skin cells. When combined with fresh water they rapidly absorb so much water that they all appear to dissolve. Each one of the millions and millions of red blood cells has burst. That is called hemolysis. Ropes made from plant fibers are also composed of cells. Test a rope: See if it shrinks in length when absorbing water or drying out. When the skin on your fingers and toes dries out, the cells shrink in size, and the skin becomes more smooth and taut, like a tight, well fitted glove. Your skin is very important. Without it yoyou would be just like a raw piece of meat, ready for the flies and germs to eat. Take good care of your skin. Do not get sunburned. When yoyou have a bad cut that is healing, yoyou should try to keep your hands out of dirty water or ponds. These contain potentially dangerous bacteria that could infect your open or healing wound. Taking a shower or washing your hands in clean water is okay. Just be sure to put antibiotic ointment and a fresh bandage over the cut when yoyou are done. Your teacher might be able to show yoyou some pictures of bacteria (germs) or let yoyou look at live ones through a microscope. Only one person is allowed to look through at a time. Everyone else must stand back and not push the observer or touch their head. Otherwise yoyou could injure one of their eyes or both by knocking them into the eyepiece or binoculars of the microscope. Some people have gone blind that way. No horsing around ! Strictly enforced. During winter, good skin care means putting lotion on your hands and wearing gloves while outside in the cold winter air. People who drink a carrot milkshake daily, made in a blender, have very beautiful skin once they have done this for six months. Healthy skin makes both boys and girls look better.",

            "First, yoyou should stick with crunches..they are less stressful on your back and focus more on the correct muscles. Then, if yoyou cut out all fat from your diet and limit your caloric intake, yoyou will see results in 3 - 4 weeks. That is, if yoyou are doing a serious ab routinue of at least 25 minutes/day (with 1 day off a week). If yoyou have a not-so-healthy eating lifestyle, doing sit ups will not help and yoyou will most likely not see any results unless yoyou are doing a complete ab workout (obliques, crunches, roman chair, scissors, leg lifts, etc.) for at least 2 hours/day. The best way is to cut fat (soda, junk food are the easiest) and gradually build into a harder and harder workout where yoyou start at 3 sets of 30 sit ups for a week and add one set and 10 reps per set every week. In ten weeks, yoyou will have a solid workout that will produce very good results. With every workout routine, yoyou should be doing a cardio-vascular exercise (running, biking, brisk walking) to burn calories. And always consult a doctor for the proper workout schedule for your age and body type.",

Genetics also play a significant role on how hard yoyou will have to work (look at family members). It also depends on how good a shape you're already in, and what other exercises you're doing. For example, if yoyou have a huge chest, the sheer circumference difference will make your waist look smaller."

Achieving a caloric deficit, where yoyou burn more calories than yoyou consume, is essential for weight loss and visible abdominal muscles. Genetic factors also contribute to the ease or difficulty of achieving defined abs, as family traits can influence body composition. Additionally, individual fitness levels and overall body shape play a role. For instance, a well-developed chest can impact the perception of waist size. Engaging in a combination of targeted exercises, maintaining a healthy diet, and considering genetic predispositions are key elements in sculpting and revealing abdominal definition."

            "In addition to the very helpful links provided by the earlier poster, it may be that newborns appear \"hairy\" without having a disorder (usually the term hirsutism implies an abnormality). A developing fetus is commonly covered with hair called lanugo hair during gestation. This hair is thought to have some insulating properties and be there because babies lack insulating fat at this time. About 36-40 weeks of gestation this lanugo hair is shed and replaced with vellus hair, a soft, peach fuzz looking hair. Some Here is a picture of a newborn with lanugo hair still present: http://www.babylink.info/Edinburgh/FAQ/..%5Cimages%5CLanugo1.jpg If the newborn is premature it may still be covered with lanugo hair, which will eventually be shed.

During fetal development, babies are covered with lanugo hair, which is believed to provide insulation since they lack sufficient fat. Between 36-40 weeks of gestation, this lanugo hair is naturally shed and replaced with vellus hair, resembling soft peach fuzz. Premature babies might retain lanugo hair temporarily, leading to the misconception of abnormal hair growth. In some cases, a family pattern may contribute to the presence of lanugo hair on newborns. Certain conditions, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia and enzymatic defects like late-onset 21- or 11-hydroxylase deficiency, can cause abnormal hair growth in newborns."

I also recommend \"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway\" by Susan Jeffers. It teaches yoyou to repeat \"I'll Handle It\", which is very helpful during a panic attack. I have suffered from panic attacks for over 3 years and the above suggestions are the only thing that have helped me.",
            "meditate",
            "Panic attacks are extremely frightening and often very disabling. Suggested methods for overcoming them depend on vairous factors including - how frequent the attacks are, what disruption they cause in your life and whether they are associated with any particular situation. If your panic attacks are repititive and frequent yoyou may have consulted a mental health professional. Psychological therapies and medication are the two main methods used. Psychological therapies like relaxation training and Exposure and response prevention aim at recognition and working through a panic attack, so that they eventually decrease in frequency. Medication is used if psychological therapies do not work, if the attacks are very severe or in conjunction with psychological treatment. Common ones have included antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, venlafaxine etc. I would steer clear of benzos as they may be habit forming and one quickly gets habituated to their actions. In the end the best person to contact may be your psychiatrist or psychologist. I have no knowledge of any other methods though they exist and information is available on the web.",
            "I have had panic attacks also. I would highly recommend trying several natural strategies before doing any prescription medication. There is a great book called \"Natural Relief for Anxiety: Complementary Strategies for Easing Fear, Panic & Worry\" that outlines various strategies. First, one of the most immediate things yoyou can do is to cut out caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and any drugs. These things obviously disrupt any physical and mental balances. Second, exercise exercise exercise. There is a lot of scientific data that says *vigorous* exercise can really be the most effective way to clean up your head and also strengthen your heart. Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks. Third, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If yoyou can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time. Fourth, when yoyou actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over \"Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon.\" As yoyou repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds. Do this sequence 20 times in a row. It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic). Fifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you. Sixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders. Yoyou will need to find out what is the root cause of your panic ... that is, what exactly are yoyou so afraid of? People do conquer panic attacks. Yoyou can do it!"

            "Constipation, infrequent or irregular bowel movements, is no fun for anyone. It can be painful and uncomfortable. Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness. Fortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation. Since dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It\u2019s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation. A healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem. Regular exercise will also assist in one\u2019s quest for regularity. Even if it\u2019s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important. If you\u2019re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help. Laxatives \u2013 There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone\u2019s personal preference.

Lemon and Honey \u2013 Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. Orange Juice and Olive Oil \u2013 Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. Licorice \u2013 Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. Grapes \u2013 A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. Castor oil and honey \u2013 Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. Something else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great!

            "Nuclear medicine is a branch of medicine and medical imaging that uses unsealed radioactive substances in diagnosis and therapy. These substances consist of radionuclides, or pharmaceuticals that have been labelled with radionuclides (radiopharmaceuticals). In diagnosis, radioactive substances are administered to patients and the radiation emitted is measured. The majority of these diagnostic tests involve the formation of an image using a gamma camera. Imaging may also be referred to as radionuclide imaging or nuclear scintigraphy. Other diagnostic tests use probes to acquire measurements from parts of the body, or counters for the measurement of samples taken from the patient. In therapy, radionuclides are administered to treat disease or provide palliative pain relief. For example, administration of iodine-131 is often used for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer. Nuclear medicine imaging tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that the tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to the anatomy. In some centres, the nuclear medicine images can be superimposed on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight which part of the body the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated in. This practice is often referred to as image fusion. Nuclear medicine diagnostic tests are usually provided by a dedicated department within a hospital and may include facilities for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. The specific name of a department can vary from hospital to hospital, with the most common names being the nuclear medicine department and the radioisotope department. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine",

If yoyou get one tiny (miniscule - as in yoyou can barely see it without a microscope) scratch or rip, yoyou will have to through it away. And your contact could fall out at any blink (nothing is more fun than having 20 people on their hands and knees looking for something the size of a dime on shag carpet!). Contacts are definetly more expensive and your eye exam has to be done yearly. Contacts can be painful if your eye gets irritated. All in all glasses are a lot less hassle, but contacts are great to have too. That's why I use both.",

I couldn't wear contacts for a while because my eyes didn't like them. I did but my eyes would burn and stayed red. With the newer lenses that allow more oxygen to get to my eye, I can wear contacts with little problem. Glasses can fall off. They can get caught on clothing. Yoyou can't just run through the rain to get into a building without having to stop to wipe your glasses or put them back on. If yoyou have to carry big things, yoyou can expect your glasses to get hit. Glasses get dirty. Glasses fog up when yoyou go from cold to hot temps. Forget sunglasses: I had a pair of nice glasses with the transition lenses and they worked for a while but not long enough to justify the cost. Contacts are far less work to me. They require cleaning and good hygiene. But once yoyou have them in, they are far less work. If yoyou don't constantly rub your eyes, yoyou don't have to worry about them falling out much. They are harder to put on than glasses but are far less work during the day. It does take a little time to get used to them but once yoyou are, they add new freedoms that glasses can't offer.

The endocervical epithelium is composed of columnar epithelial cells that line the inner surface of the uterus, including the cervical canal and uterine cavity. These cells, also known as glandular cells, are typically present in PAP smears, and they are often found in groups resembling honeycombs. When isolated, they appear cylindrical from the side and round from above. The typical characteristics of endocervical cells include a size of about 180 micro meter squared, a cyanophilic and translucent or vacuolated cytoplasm, and round to oval nuclei measuring approximately 50 micro meter squared. The nuclei are often eccentrically located and vesicular, with finely distributed chromatin that stains more dark blue than the cytoplasm. These cells, which exhibit minimal size variation during the menstrual cycle, may also possess cilia. In summary, endocervical cells are a distinct cell type located within the cervix."

            "Eczema Treatment While eczema cannot be cured, most cases can be controlled by: Making lifestyle modifications to prevent flare-ups Seeing a dermatologist for treatment Using medication as prescribed This approach tends to prevent inflammation and itching and keeps eczema from getting worse. Dermatologists recommend that treatment be sought at the onset of signs and symptoms. When therapy begins early, it often reduces severity and duration. Diagnosis Effective treatment requires a correct diagnosis; however, it is not always easy to distinguish one type of eczema from another or from similar skin conditions. Dermatologists have the medical training and experience needed to determine if eczema is present \u2014 and if present, which type. To diagnose eczema, dermatologists examine the skin and ask about: When the skin condition first appeared Signs and symptoms, such as long-term pruritus (itching) or recurring dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) Certain circumstances that may aggravate the condition, such as excessively dry air or emotional stress Family medical history, including questions about close blood relatives who have asthma, hay fever, or eczema Personal medical history In some cases, a skin biopsy may be performed to rule out other causes. Allergies are more common in individuals with atopic dermatitis, and allergy testing may be considered when a patient has: Significant indications of allergies, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and colic in infants) or hives Been poorly responsive or unresponsive to treatment If a food allergy is suspected, testing for allergic reactions to eggs, milk, peanuts, soy, wheat, fish, and tree nuts (e.g., walnuts, cashews) are usually performed as these foods are responsible for 85% of all food allergies. A positive allergy test does not confirm the food allergy. A suspected food allergy must be subjected to a \"challenge.\" A challenge is conducted by having the patient eat the suspected food and observing the patient for a reaction. Even a challenge does not guarantee that the food is the trigger because: 1) another trigger may be present and causing the reaction or 2) the patient\u2019s reaction may be delayed. Consequently, allergy testing has limited value. However, it is useful for eliminating foods that cause immediate and severe reactions or welts. Dermatologists may use a \u201cpatch test\u201d to determine if the patient has allergic contact dermatitis, a type of eczema that develops when the person has an allergic reaction to a substance that contacts the skin. The reaction generally occurs a few hours after the substance contacts the skin and settles down within a few days if the substance does not contact the skin again. A patch test exposes the patient\u2019s skin to minute amounts of substances that may have caused the reaction. When the test is positive, the dermatologist must determine if the chemical caused the dermatitis and if so, if it is the primary cause or an aggravating factor. Further testing may be necessary. Treatment Once eczema is diagnosed, a treatment plan will be made based on: Type and severity of the eczema present Age, health, and medical history (including presence of other conditions) History of previous treatment The primary goal of treatment is to relieve discomfort by controlling the signs and symptoms. Since eczema is usually dry and itchy, most treatment plans involve applying lotions, creams, or ointments to keep the skin as moist as possible. The treatment plan also may require lifestyle modifications and using medication as directed. A topical (applied to the skin) medication may be prescribed to help relieve itching and inflammation. Another way to treat the itch is with a non-sedating antihistamine. If itching is severe, a sedative antihistamine may be recommended. Skin infections caused by bacteria, such as staphylococ",

Women's life span depends on the balance of two forces, according to Thomas Perls, a geriatrician at Harvard Medical School. One is the evolutionary drive to pass on her genes, the other is the need to stay healthy enough to rear as many children as possible. \"Menopause draws the line between the two,\" Perls says. It protects older women from the risks of bearing children late in life, and lets them live long enough to take care of their children and grandchildren.\" Read more at the source link.",

For instance, studies have indicated that estrogen can have a protective effect against Alzheimer's Disease. Additionally, factors such as women engaging in less strenuous work and experiencing menopause contribute to the understanding of longevity. Harvard researchers studying centenarians propose that menopause is a significant determinant of lifespan for both women and men. According to Thomas Perls, a geriatrician at Harvard Medical School, women's longevity is influenced by a delicate balance between the evolutionary drive to pass on genes and the need to remain healthy enough to raise multiple generations. Menopause serves as a crucial factor, safeguarding older women from the risks associated with late-life childbirth and allowing them to live long enough to care for their children and grandchildren."

            "I would contact a dermatologist for the 'best' way. Other steps 1. Wash your face at least twice a day with a mild cleanser. Use a pH-balanced cleanser without perfumes or too many chemical additives. 2. Touch your face as little as possible, and only when your hands are clean. 3. Avoid squeezing pimples. Bacteria on your hands or on unsterile equipment can lead to more blemishes and possible scarring. 4. Steam your face once or twice a week to help open the pores. Boil water, remove the pot from the stove, drape a towel over your head and hold your face over the pot. Then rinse your face with cold water. 5. Use essential oils such as calendula, chamomile, juniper, lavendar and mint directly on your skin. Mix 10 drops of any of the oils with 2 tbsp. soy or almond oil, and smooth a few drops on dampened skin. 6. Try using herbs. Saw palmetto can help balance boys' hormones, while chaste tree berry can do the same for girls. Echinacea, alfalfa, burdock root, cayenne, chaparral and yellow dock root are also helpful. 7. Consider other topical mixtures. Beat an egg yolk, apply it with a cotton ball and leave it on for 15 minutes. Alternatively, mix oatmeal and honey together to form a paste and apply it to your face. Oatmeal soaks up excess oil and honey soothes the skin. 8. Take acidophilus to fight bacteria. 9. Eat a diet high in fiber, including whole grains and fresh vegetables and fruits, to keep your body healthy overall and provide nutrients to your skin. Stay away from junk food, caffeine and salty foods. 10. Determine whether specific foods aggravate your skin and eliminate them from your diet. 11. Consider adding zinc supplements to your diet. 12.

Get creative, and be satisfied with what you've got. A selfish or non-understanding partner would probably not only be extremely stressful and unfulfilling, but probably would tell yoyou a whole lot about them.

Started with one tablet with each meal. Yoyou have learn to use it. It will take some time. I tried different brands, the one which I liked is from PURITAN PRIDE (THEY ARE ON THE INTERNET). - During 9 years my sugar used to be more than 350 all the time.

Gymnema Sylvestre I started about 1 1/2 years after that. Now instead of whole wheat I eat white flower and boiled chicken, lentils, etc. - I was tired of people giving me all kind of suggestions, so I decided to do some work myself. For about couple of weeks I tested my sugar(around 40 times) before and after eating different foods. It gave me most of the facts. By the way I found sugar from whole wheat sits in your body for 6 to 14 days. - I also learned acidic foods raise blood sugar weight etc.It happens because overacidity is like meat tenderizer. Tissue damage in the stomach does not allow yoyou to digest food properly. Also agressive exercise can also damage stomach tissues, leading to excessive weight. Try avoiding just for couple of weeks see what yoyou find? - Presently I am taking Glyburide, Actos, and Lentus (insulin replacement shots) My recommendation is search google for gymnema sylvestre, and overacidity. also do not trust anybody including you, verify everything, if yoyou can.

The disorder, presumably lifelong, may affect as many as 3 to 5% of the population and is most often detected serendipitously in young adults with unrelated nonspecific complaints. Some family members may be affected, but a clear genetic pattern is often difficult to establish. The pathogenesis is uncertain. There appear to be complex defects in the liver's uptake of plasma bilirubin, which usually fluctuates between 2 and 5 mg/dL (34 and 86 \u00b5mol/L) and tends to increase with fasting and other stresses. In addition, glucuronyl transferase activity is low; therefore, the disorder may be related to Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. Many patients also have mildly diminished RBC survival, but this is insufficient to explain the hyperbilirubinemia. Gilbert's syndrome can be easily differentiated from hepatitis by normal liver function tests, absence of urinary bile, and predominantly unconjugated bilirubin fractionation. Hemolysis is differentiated by the absence of anemia or reticulocytosis. Liver histology is normal, but biopsy is not needed for diagnosis. Patients should be reassured that they do not have liver disease.",

Patients typically have low glucuronyl transferase activity and slightly reduced red blood cell lifespan. Key differentiators from other conditions include normal liver function, absence of urinary bile, and unconjugated bilirubin predominance. Liver biopsy isn't necessary for diagnosis.

        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, a girl experiences a monthly period as a result of ovulation, during which an egg is released, and hormonal changes lead to the shedding of part of the uterine wall, resulting in menstruation. The potential for pregnancy arises if sperm successfully meets the egg at the right time, but conception isn't guaranteed with every encounter. While menstruation is a biological aspect of womanhood, becoming a woman involves more than just this monthly occurrence; it entails adopting womanly thoughts and actions. Pregnancy can occur whenever the egg is met with sperm, but once pregnant, a woman ceases ovulation, preventing the possibility of conceiving another baby. The process is described as a combination of effort and, in the context of the narrator, being subject to divine will."

            "Peptic ulcer is usually a non-malignant ulcer of the stomach (called gastric ulcer) or duodenum (called duodenal ulcer). About 4 % of gastric ulcers are caused by malignant tumour, which is why ulcers of stomach are controlled. Duodenal ulcers are non-malignant. By far most instances are now known to be due to Helicobacter pylori, a spiral-shaped bacterium that lives in the acid environment of the stomach. These ulcers can also be caused or worsened by drugs such as Aspirin and other NSAIDs. Signs and symptoms: Abdominal pain; Hematemesis (vomiting blood); Melena (tarry feces due to oxidised iron from hemoglobin); Weight loss; Rarely, an ulcer can lead to a gastric or duodenal perforation. This is extremely painful and requires immediate surgery. A history of heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and use of certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer are NSAID (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase 1, and most glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone). In patients over 45 with more than 2 weeks of the above symptoms the odds for peptic ulceration are high enough to warrant rapid investigation by EGD (see below). The timing of the symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal, as gastric acid is secreted, or after the meal, as the alkaline duodenal contents reflux into the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would manifest mostly before the meal \u2014 when acid (production stimulated by hunger) is passed into the duodenum"

This is what one site had to say: \"Synchronous menstruation has been observed among mothers, sisters, and daughters who live together, and sometimes among women who simply work together. Of seven female lifeguards who started out one summer with widely scattered periods. Three months later they were all menstruating within four days of one another. A study of 135 residents of a women's college dorm confirmed the effect. Most of the cycle shifting occurred within the first four months and was usually complete after seven months. Fortunately for the dorm's plumbing, the whole building didn't synchronize, just roommates and close friends. As often as not, the women were unaware of what had happened. Later research has suggested that synchrony is caused by some sort of scent cue, or pheromone.\"",

This makes all three human bodies more efficient from the \"mechanisms\" view point.",

The mechanism behind this phenomenon is not fully understood, but it has been suggested that hormonal signaling plays a role."

        "question": "what is spinalcord lesions?",
        "answers": [
            "A. General comments The complex of anatomy of the vertebral column and the great concentration of important tracts in a structure of small cross-sectional area are unique features related to spinal cord injury. A number of factors influence the severity of pathological changes and functional deficits after spinal cord trauma, including age and the flexibility of the body, the size of the bony canal as influenced by heredity, degenerative changes of joints and intravertebral discs and variations in blood supply. The spinal levels most commonly involved with injury are the lower cervical spine (C4, C5, C6, C7, T1) and the thoracolumbar juncture (T12, L1, L2), the areas of greater mobility. B. Pathophysiology 1. The spinal cord and nerve roots may be injured by: a. Compression from bone, ligaments, extruded disc material and tumors. b. Disruption or overstretching of neural tissues c. Edema following compression or concussion d. Disturbance of circulation 2. Mechanisms of injury a. Direct injury results from force applied directly to the back of the neck or trunk and may cause fractures of spinous processes of laminal arches, concussion of the spinal cord, or direct compression of neural tissue by depressed bone fragments. Lacerations can result from knife or bullet wounds. b. Indirect injury is a more common mechanism resulting from forces applied to the head and trunk or from movements that exceed the normal range, e.g. when the head is suddenly accelerated or decelerated in relation to the trunk. C. Pathological changes The most common pathological changes are contusions, with necrosis, swelling and hemorrhage acutely to variable extents. Chronic changes include macrophages, gliosis and loss of architecture. In addition, edema may occur in areas that do not show contusions and infarction may result from impairment of circulation. Wallerian degeneration in distal axons will occur. D. Clinical signs Neurological symptoms vary from complete loss of function below the injured segments to temporary loss of cord function with complete recovery. Specific symptoms depend on the site of injury. e.g. posterior horn or column injury produces paresthesias, pain and other sensory disturbances; anterior horn or corticospinal tract damage results in weakness or paralysis. After denervation, fibrillations, fasciculations, muscle atrophy, and groups of atrophic fibers in a muscle biopsy will be seen. E. Types of injury 1. Fracture dislocation of the spine 2. Hyperextension or hyperflexion with cord compression by a displaced vertebral body fragment. 3. Cervical spondylosis 4. Intervertebral disc abnormalities and other osseous pathology, e.g. herniated lumbar disc 5. Neoplasms (intramedullary or extramedullary)",

Lots of activity can help to lower sugar levels,such as walking and swimming. Ask a doctor before running or lifting weights because if yoyou have weak capillaries in your eyes or something,yoyou can burst them and go blind. Supplements such as GTF Chromium at 200mg 3 times a day with meals have helped reduce sugar levels in some people,as well as vanadium(vanadyle sulfate), gymnema sylvestra, bean pod tea, blue berry extract, cinnamon,and many other herbs and vitamin supplements have been reported to aid in reducing sugar levels in some people. Work with yoyou doctor in using these and other supplements,and drink plenty of water.",

Going below 70 may lead to shakiness due to low sugar levels. About 3 hours after a normal meal, sugar levels for diabetics should be around 120-150, avoiding going over 200 mg/dL, and returning under 120 within approximately 3 hours. Non-diabetics often have readings of 85-95 mg/dL, regardless of recent meals or activities. Regular physical activity, like walking and swimming, can help lower sugar levels. It's crucial to consult a doctor before engaging in intense activities to avoid potential health risks. Some supplements, such as GTF Chromium, vanadium, gymnema sylvestra, bean pod tea, blueberry extract, and cinnamon, have been reported to aid in reducing sugar levels, but it's essential to work with a doctor and stay hydrated."

So working out 24 hours a day as stated above is pure stupidity. also 3X 20 sets is another stupid answer which will lead to what i already stated above. now here is the way to build muscle properly and increase the speed in which yoyou will gain them: the secret to gaining muscle is to shock your muscles every work out. this can be done in the following ways: -changing the order of the exercise each work out - changing the speed at which yoyou lift the weights, slow or faster -super sets which means doing two or more opposite or same body part exercises - giant sets which means no rest between all sets performed for a specific body part - negatives which means lowering the weight very slowly after one rep - stripping which means lifting the heaviest weight yoyou can to muscle failure (when yoyou can lift it anymore) for no more than 6-8 repetitions and then going to a slightly lower weight + repeat that's only a few ways to shock your muscles into growing. Muscles have a memory so yoyou must vary and change your routine and shocking methods constantly. also there is the diet component: proteins: make sure yoyou eat a palm size protein portion every meal, which should be every 3 hours that yoyou arent sleeping and do not eatt 3 hours before going to bed to prevent food from metabolizing into fat. carbs: 2 clenched fists is the ideal portion fats: olive oils, flaxseed oils, peanuts, almonds, no more than 10-12 or a table spoon per meal for the oils make sure yoyou do not work the same muscle groups within 48 hours or 2 days to give them time to recover and grow. make sure yoyou sleep at least 8 hours, as much of the recovery occurs during sleep. make sure yoyou eat no more than 1 hour after your work outs make sure yoyou have a protein shake before going to bed, no other food if possible throw junk food, alcohol, and other tempting food in the garbage. keep your training to 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions per exercise@ 3 exercises per body part any more question, visit this excellent site bellow, and good luck",

            "The first answer seems to be correct.",
            "Headache: A headache is a pain in the head with the pain being above the eyes or the ears, behind the head (occipital), or in the back of the upper neck. Headache, like chest pain or back ache, has many causes. All headaches are considered primary headaches or secondary headaches. Primary headaches are not associated with other diseases. Examples of primary headaches are migraine headaches, tension headaches, and cluster headaches. Secondary headaches are caused by other diseases. The associated disease may be minor or major. Tension headaches are the most common type of primary headache. As many as 90% of adults have tension headaches. Tension headaches are more common among women than men. Migraine headaches are the second most common type of primary headache. An estimated 28 million people in the US have migraine headaches. Migraine headaches affect children as well as adults. Before puberty, boys and girls are affected equally by migraine headaches, but after puberty more women than men have them. Migraine often goes undiagnosed or is misdiagnosed as tension or sinus headaches. Cluster headaches are a rare but important type of primary headache, affecting mainly men. The average age of cluster headache sufferers is 28-30 years, although headaches may begin in childhood. Secondary headaches may result from innumerable conditions, ranging from life threatening ones such as brain tumors, strokes, meningitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhages to less serious but common conditions such as withdrawal from caffeine and discontinuation of analgesics (pain killing medication). Many people suffer from \"mixed\" headache disorders in which tension headaches or secondary headaches may trigger migraine. Stomach ache: Pain in the belly (abdomen) can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs. The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although abdominal pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity (i.e., skin and abdominal wall muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe pain originating from organs within the abdominal cavity (i.e., beneath the skin and muscles). These organs include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Occasionally, pain may be felt in the abdomen even though it is arising from organs that are close to but not within the abdominal cavity, for example, the lower lungs, the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries. This latter type of pain is called \"referred\" pain because the pain, though originating outside the abdomen, is being referred to (felt) in the abdominal area. Abdominal pain can be acute and sudden in onset, or the pain can be chronic and longstanding. Abdominal pain may be minor and of no great significance, or it can reflect a major problem involving one of the organs in the abdomen. The characteristics of the pain--location, timing, duration, etc. are important in diagnosing its cause. Persisting abdominal pain should be evaluated by a physician."

Secondary headaches arise from various conditions, ranging from life-threatening issues to less severe problems.

See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation.

            "Yoyou need to target exercises on your abdominal muscles.",
            "In order to be succeed at thinning your waistline, yoyou have to get a basic under standing of how the abdominal muscles function and how your body burns fat. The first thing that yoyou need to understand is the difference between fat and muscle tissue. Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement. Fat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But yoyou can lose muscle mass while yoyou gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older. So if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing yoyou need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. The most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep yoyou from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). Yoyou have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often yoyou will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. If yoyou want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles yoyou need to incorporate these exercises: 1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.) 1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.) 1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.) Your abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. Yoyou also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time. Increase metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more! This means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! Here's a simple interval workout that yoyou can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc). Warm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes Perform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible) perform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath) Repeat this process from 6-10 times Cool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes Maintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, yoyou have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off! To stabilize your blood sugar level yoyou have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would yoyou only feed it once or twice a day? Give your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). Most people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn\u2019t matter where they come from. If there\u2019s extra it's going to body fat! I'm not saying that what yoyou eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn\u2019t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat. Make healthy choices whenever possible, but don\u2019t feel like every cheeseburger yoyou eat is guaranteed to be st",

            "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neuron cells in the spinal cord and brain, which ultimately results in paralysis and death. The disease takes its less-scientific name from Loyou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. In 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain. Recent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS"

Surgery or the use of a bulky face mask was the only proven way to quiet nighttime noise. But now there's new hope thanks to a new treatment called the pillar procedure. How the Pillar Procedure works The Pillar Procedure addresses one of the anatomical components of sleep apnea and snoring: the soft palate. During the Pillar Procedure, three tiny woven inserts are placed in the soft palate to help reduce the vibration that causes snoring and the ability of the soft palate to obstruct the airway. Once in place, the inserts add structural support to the soft palate. Over time, the body's natural tissue response to the inserts increases the structural integrity of the soft palate. http://www.restoremedical.com/pillar.asp",

For instance, Mom is cold at 72 degrees and that's just too hot for me. In the research that has been done, \"cold\" is usually around 40 degrees with their feet in cold water. Even spending quite a bit of time like this, people were still no more likely to catch a cold when directly exposed to cold germs. Another reason I point out the relativity of being cold. This idea has been around a long, long time. When I read books written in the 1800s, the characters will talk about breaking the ice that had formed on the bedside water pitcher. These people were sleeping in temperatures far colder than most people in developed countries can even conceive of. Still, it does seem like people get more colds during winter. It should be noted that this is the same whether yoyou are in Chicago or LA. It's possible that germs like it a touch cooler than we do, or it's possible we simply stay inside more, which leads to a greater chance of being exposed to other peoples colds (also, there's a lot more travelling and socializing in November/December - yet more chances to catch a cold). It could be that a good number of cases of colds are just \"cold stress\" - a reaction our bodies have to sudden changes in weather. I know that my nose will run whenever we get a cold front come through. We have no real data, even on whether there really are more colds in the winter.

        "question": "What should I do about chapped lips?",
        "answers": [
            "The first step in preventing chapped lips is to stop licking. Constant wetting and drying sucks the moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which prompts more licking, creating a vicious cycle. Dehydrated lips are also more susceptible to dry, windy conditions. -- A moisturizing lip balm, especially those containing dimethicone, will help retain natural moisture and protect dry, chapped lips. -- Drinking lots of water will help prevent dehydration, which may contribute to chapped lips and dry skin. -- Smoothing a generous coating of lip balm on lips before bed will help to moisturize lips while yoyou sleep. -- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. -- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. -- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips. Also keep acidic foods from touching delicate lips until they've healed. -- Lip exfoliators such as Softlips Nightly Care(TM) buff away dry, dead skin cells and stimulate growth of new, vibrant cells. The interactive Beta Hydroxy formula of Softlips Nightly Care(TM) conditions lips that may be sensitive to strong Alpha Hydroxy chemical peels, and the overnight system helps reduce concern about sun damage to freshly exfoliated skin.

Obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining to pass stool can cause the intestine to push against the inguinal canal. Symptoms of inguinal hernia may include a lump in the groin near the thigh; pain in the groin; and, in severe cases, partial or complete blockage of the intestine. The doctor diagnoses hernia by doing a physical exam and by taking x rays and blood tests to check for blockage in the intestine. The main treatment for inguinal hernia is surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty. If the protruding intestine becomes twisted or traps stool, part of the intestine might need to be removed. This surgery is called bowel resection. (Bowel is another word for intestine.)",
            "Its a protrusion of abdominal content frm inguinal canal. It must be treated to prevent further complications. Another hernia is femoral hernia where the content comes frm femoral canal. There are many other uncomman hernia also."

        "labelled_summary": "If left untreated, a hernia can lead to severe and potentially fatal consequences. A hernia occurs when part of the intestine protrudes through a weakened area in the abdominal muscles, particularly in the groin for an inguinal hernia. Factors such as obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining can contribute to its development. Symptoms include a lump in the groin, pain, and, in severe cases, intestinal blockage. Diagnosis involves a physical exam, x-rays, and blood tests. The primary treatment is surgery, either herniorrhaphy to repair the muscle opening or hernioplasty to reinforce it with mesh or wire. In some cases, bowel resection may be necessary if the protruding intestine is twisted or trapping stool. The passage also mentions femoral hernia as another type and acknowledges various uncommon hernias."

        "question": "I'm looking for advice on gout pain. I do not want to take a prescription. Anything to use to stop reocurrance",
        "answers": [
            "Gout is caused by too much uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia). Hyperuricemia usually does no harm, and most people with high levels of uric acid in the blood never develop gout. When uric acid levels in the blood are too high, uric acid may form crystals that accumulate in the joints. The exact cause of hyperuricemia sometimes goes undiscovered, although inherited factors (genes) seem to play a role. Gout can seem to flare up without specific cause or can be brought on by factors such as being overweight, eating meats and seafood that are high in chemicals called purines, taking certain medications (especially aspirin and diuretics), and drinking too much alcohol. My own father and aunt have suffered with gout. This is often a forerunner to diabetes. Here are a few things yoyou can do to prevent an \"attack\" of gout. 1)Ease up on red meat. NEVER eat rare meat. Purines are contained in Beef,Pork,Lamb,Seafood, Yeast (used in beer and bread),Alcoholic beverages, particularly beer,and Bacon. 2) Drink lots of water. If yoyou were drinking enough water your kidneys would filter the uric acid. 3) Drink low fat milk. This will help \"eat\" the uric acid from your blood. Now the next issue is don't be silly about popping a pill. This drives doctors and pharmacists CRAZY! Have yoyou ever heard of better living through modern chemistry? If fact, there is an amazing new drug to treat Gout; Febuxostat. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about it. This is the first new treatment for Gout in 40 years. Below I have included a link about the new treatment from TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc."

        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, gout is primarily caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, a condition known as hyperuricemia. Although hyperuricemia is often harmless and not everyone with high uric acid levels develops gout, factors such as genetics, being overweight, consuming purine-rich foods (such as meats and seafood), taking specific medications (like aspirin and diuretics), and excessive alcohol intake can contribute to the development of gout. Drinking an adequate amount of water helps the kidneys filter out uric acid, and including low-fat milk in the diet can aid in reducing uric acid levels. While certain lifestyle changes can help manage gout, new medications like Febuxostat offer an innovative approach to treating this condition, marking the first significant advancement in Gout treatment in four decades. It's essential not to self-prescribe medication and consult healthcare professionals for appropriate guidance."

Lots of things can enter the equation -- general physical health, type of lung cancer, other health conditions, where it has spread to, treatment choices, age, nutrition, etc. And it is important to remember that even if the survival rates are low -- yoyou could still be one of the survivors! I would start by seing a medical oncologist -- ideally one who tends to focus on lung cancers. They will be in the best position to offer treatment alternatives and outlooks. Think about what questions yoyou want to answer and write them down before yoyou go. Take someone with yoyou -- task them with being sure all of your questions get asked and have them take notes. Don't hesitate to ask the doctor to slow down or provide more information. If yoyou are interested in prognosis and treatment alternatives -- ask! Some patients seem to prefer less information in that area and some mds wait for the topic to be brought up. Some patients fight the disease with everthing medicine has to offer (some of which comes with significant side effects and/or contain invasive techniques). Other choose to receive no medical treatment. Still others pick and choose treatments with an eye towards quality of life rather than life extension. If yoyou are in the latter category, good questions to ask about any treatment approach (including no treatment) is: a) what is the impact on quality of life; b) what is the impact on life extension; and c) what are the potential side effects and how likely are they. Regardless of your philosophy, communicate your approach to your doctor. They are in the business of helping yoyou and they can best meet your needs when they understand what they are. Also, please remember that any decisions yoyou make can be reversed -- yoyou can start with very aggresive tx and back off if the disease responds poorly (or your body responds poorly to the tx). Finally, allow yoyou oncologist to help yoyou with all of the symptoms -- some come from the disease while others can come from the tx. Don't try and gut it out. Let yoyou md know about things like depression, anxiety, pain, appetite, nausea. To some extent, these can be pretty effectively dealt with in the home. Now is also the time to consider things like what heroic measures yoyou would like taken if yoyou fall very ill and fill out forms such a DPA for health care.

        "question": "what is the best way to go through the grieving process of loosing a loved one?",
        "answers": [
            "It does take time to grieve, and it often takes much longer than people think. This is especially true if yoyou witnessed the violent death of your fiance. One of the ways that people grieve is to talk about the person they lost, the event if they witness it, and how their life is different since their loss. One of the problems is that people around yoyou often feel that yoyou should be over it by now, and they may not be as available to listen. So yoyou might want to check out a community bereavement group that might allow yoyou to talk with others over a period of a few months. For many people this helps them to process their loss. For the record, I don't think yoyou ever \"get over\" someone, but yoyou are able to put the loss in perspective. I've heard people say that \"I haven't forgotten the person, but I can now think about them without crying!\" Your local hospice, hospital, mental health association or even a local funeral home may offer bereavement groups. Most of the time they are free of charge, as well. Since yoyou did witness the violent death of your fiance, yoyou might also have some issues related to that trauma itself. If yoyou have other symptoms of anxiety or depression yoyou might want to talk this over with your doctor or a mental health professional.",
            "Everybody goes through it differently, and it can take time. Yoyou just don't get over someone yoyou love who dies--suddenly or otherwise. Plus, yoyou say he was killed in front of you--that suggests it may have been violent. Dealing with that aspect alone is a major undertaking. If yoyou haven't already, yoyou really need to talk about it with someone--even if it's just your boyfriend. If he cares for you, he'll at least be a sympathetic ear. Yoyou should consider a professional, too--maybe just a clergyman yoyou know. They're all trained in some basic counseling skills. To move on from someone's death means accepting it, and yoyou may need some help with that.",
            "Active, healthy grieving requires balance -- balancing the time yoyou spend directly working on your grief with the time yoyou spend coping with your day-to-day life; balancing the amount of time yoyou spend with others with the time yoyou spend alone; balancing your need for help from others with caring for yourself. Focusing too strongly on any single side of these pairings is getting off-track. Here are some things others have found useful in their healthy grieving. Grieving takes energy that will likely have to be temporarily withdrawn from the usual pursuits of your life. Treat yourself with the same care, tolerance, and affection yoyou would extend to a valued friend in a similar situation. Healthy grieving is an active process. It is NOT true that, \"Yoyou just need to give it time.\" One way of understanding the work to be done is to think of grieving as a series of tasks we need to complete (not necessarily in sequence): * To accept the finality of the loss; * To acknowledge and express the full range of feelings we experience as a result of the loss; * To adjust to a life in which the lost person, object, or experience is absent; * To 'say good-bye,' to ritualize our movement to a new peace with the loss."
        ],
        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, grieving, especially after witnessing the violent death of a fianc\u00e9, is a process that demands more time than commonly perceived. It involves coping with the profound impact of the loss by discussing the departed individual, the traumatic event, and the subsequent changes in one's life. A significant challenge arises from societal expectations that may pressure individuals to move on quickly, leaving them with limited support. Joining a community bereavement group is suggested, offering a space where individuals can share their experiences over several months, fostering a supportive environment crucial for processing and navigating the complexities of grief."

            "A nurse practitioner (NP) is a registered nurse with advanced academic and clinical experience, which enables him or her to diagnose and manage most common and many chronic illnesses, either independently or as part of a health care team. A nurse practitioner provides some care previously offered only by physicians and in most states has the ability to prescribe medications. Working in collaboration with a physician, a nurse practitioner provides high-quality, cost-effective and individualized care for the lifespan of patient's special needs. NPs focus largely on health maintenance, disease prevention, counseling and patient education in a wide variety of settings. With a strong emphasis on primary care, nurse practitioners are employed within several specialties, including neonatology, nurse-midwifery, pediatrics, school health, family and adult health, women's health, mental health, home care, geriatrics and acute care. Nurse practitioners are educated through programs that grant either a certificate or a master's degree. A registered nurse is recommended to have extensive clinical experience before applying to a nurse practitioner program. An intensive preceptorship under the direct supervision of a physician or an experienced nurse practitioner, as well as instruction in nursing theory, are key components to most NP programs. physician assistants (PAs) are non-physicians licensed to practice medicine with a physician's supervision. This supervision, in most cases, need not be direct or on site and many PAs practice in remote or underserved areas in satellite clinics. PAs can treat patients and, in most states, prescribe medicine, and in some states in the US they carry a DEA number that gives them authority to prescribe controlled medications like narcotics. PAs in surgical practices also serve as first assists in surgery. PAs provide medical services that are reimbursed under Medicare and third party insurances. Physician assistants and Nurse Practitioners both provide similar services in most states, the major distinction being that nurse practitioners are registered nurses by trade. Both are also known as Advanced Practice Clinicians (APCs) or mid-level practitioners (MLPs)."

Children born with an undescended testicle have an increased risk of getting testicular cancer, regardless of whether surgery is done to correct the problem.

While pain in the testes or scrotum may or may not be present, it's crucial to be aware of any unusual bumps on the testicles. Testicular cancer is more prevalent in young men aged 15 to 35 but can occur in other age groups, necessitating awareness of its symptoms by all men. Although relatively rare, testicular cancer is highly curable if detected early. Men often discover it themselves through the identification of painless lumps, changes in testicle size, or testicular pain. Individuals born with an undescended testicle face an increased risk of testicular cancer, emphasizing the importance of corrective surgery to preserve fertility. The elevated cancer risk is attributed to the underlying cause of the undescended testicle, not solely its undescended state."

        "answers": [
            "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). Multiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age. The exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system. The inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission). Recurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur. Researchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved. People with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease. Check out this article with excellent illustrations: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm",
            "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS) - that's the brain and spinal cord. Predominantly, it is a disease of the \"white matter\" tissue. The white matter is made up of nerve fibres which are responsible for transmitting communication signals both internally within the CNS and between the CNS and the nerves supplying rest of the body.",

        "question": "what is thephysiology of thirst?",
        "answers": [
            "Thirst and drinking function to maintain body water balance and are basic to survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors. Thirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).",
            "To put it simply, yoyou loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water. Its caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain. IF yoyou are thirsty, yoyou are 1% dehyradted."

        "answers": [
            "I just answered another VERY similar question in the pregnancy section, so I'll just repost it here, verbatim. Taken from http://www.ovulation-calculator.com/conception.htm Understanding how the menstrual cycle functions - and what happens during ovulation - is key to the successful prediction of ovulation. But what happens exactly? Let's look at the dynamics of fertility and conception. During your menstrual cycle, there are far more infertile days than fertile days. The fertile days are days when there is a possibility for conceiving. However, within your fertile period - the window of opportunity for conception - there are days of \"peak fertility\". Identifying these peak times, and planning accordingly, can help maximize your chances of becoming pregnant. The Dynamics of Fertility A woman's fertile period during her menstrual cycle, on average, lasts about 9 days. The most fertile period consists of the few days before ovulation. There are a number of reasons why this is the most fertile time. First of all, the amount of cervical fluid increases - and the consistency of the mucus changes substantially (from being sticky and cloudy to becoming transparent, white, and slippery). The purpose of this change is to create a healthy medium for the sperm to survive and travel in. Given a fertile environment, sperm can live several days. The egg, on the other hand, can live only 24 hours - so timing is important. At the moment of ovulation, the body temperature begins to rise to create a warmer, more hospitable environment for a fertilized egg. Also, the cervix will start to rise, soften, and begin to open up. Hormones and Ovulation: The Release of the Egg During ovulation, a number of different hormonal changes take place. Early in the menstrual cycle, a hormone called Follicle Stimulating Hormone - or FSH - enables your ovaries to nurture eggs. Within the ovaries, follicles house each individual developing egg. The follicles that hold the eggs will secrete estrogen. As the menstrual cycle progresses, the follicle containing the developing egg moves toward the surface of the ovary. Immediately before ovulation, the follicle begins secreting estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen helps the uterine lining thicken and expand, and increases blood flow to the uterus. Progesterone causes the glands of the uterine lining to form secretions that help nourish a fertilized egg. Ovulation By definition, ovulation is the process of an ovary releasing an egg from the follicle - permitting the egg to float down the fallopian tubes. On average, the first phase of the menstrual cycle last two weeks. Directly prior to ovulation, another hormonal change takes place - the LH Surge. LH (or Luteinizing Hormone) is the hormone that actually facilitates ovulation: it causes the egg to separate from the ovarian surface. Ovulation predictor tests function by detecting this LH Surge, thus alerting the woman that ovulation is about to take place. Once released from the ovaries (post-ovulation), the egg can survive for about 24 hours. This means that sperm (which can live several days) must be present to fertilize the egg. Following ovulation, the egg enters the fallopian tubes and continues toward the womb. Typically, conception - the uniting of the egg and the sperm - will take place in the fallopian tube, and then the fertilized egg will continue its passage to the uterus and implant in the uterine wall. For pregnancy to take place, fertilization of the egg must be followed by a successful implantation. Following ovulation, the luteal phase begins, marked by an increase of the hormone progesterone, which strengthens the uterine lining (endometrium) and causes the body temperature to increase, facilitates changes in the cervical fluid, and alters the position of the cervix. Within 24 hours, if the egg has not been fertilized, it will simply disintegrate after reaching the uterus. Without fertilization - and i",

        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, during the menstrual cycle, there are more infertile days than fertile days, with the most fertile period lasting about 9 days. The peak fertility days occur just before ovulation when hormonal changes lead to increased cervical fluid, a rise in body temperature, and changes in the cervix's position. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) nurtures developing eggs in the ovaries, and estrogen and progesterone secretions from follicles prepare the uterus for a fertilized egg. Ovulation, triggered by Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surge, releases an egg that can survive for about 24 hours. For conception, sperm must be present during this time. Following ovulation, the luteal phase begins with increased progesterone, preparing the uterus and causing temperature changes. If the egg remains unfertilized, it disintegrates within 24 hours. Understanding these dynamics can help maximize the chances of conception."

Like herpes, it is inactive at times, but it is incurable and is a life-time infection. CMV may be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and is the most common congenital viral infection. It is also called congenital cytomegalovirus or cytomegalovirus inclusion disease. CMV without symptoms is common in babies and young children. It is found in saliva, urine, semen, and other body fluids. The virus is easily spread in households and in daycare centers. It can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during delivery or in breast milk. Over half of women of childbearing age become infected with CMV at least six months before becoming pregnant. There appear to be few risks for complications of CMV for this group and only a few babies have the infection at birth. These babies appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities. About 90 percent of babies who are infected with CMV have no symptoms at birth. But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities \u2014 such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss \u2014 usually in the first year or two of life. Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of hearing loss in children. About one in 1,000 babies (about 4,000 babies each year) shows symptoms of CMV at birth. These symptoms may include an enlarged spleen or liver, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a distinctive rash. Up to 20 percent of these babies die, and about 90 percent of the survivors suffer from serious neurological defects, such as mental retardation. At present there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the effects of congenital CMV. However, doctors are investigating whether a new antiviral drug called ganciclovir \u2014 which is used to treat adults with AIDS who have CMV-related eye infections \u2014 also may help babies with congenital CMV."

Using a regular toothbrush is recommended over a \"special\" brush, as it effectively removes bacteria from the tongue.

In general, these defects are obvious and include facial bone hypoplasia (under-development), a long, underdeveloped philtrum (the groove in the middle of the upper lip), a thin upper lip, a short nose, and ptosis (drooping of the eyelids). Although the typical facial features may not be as apparent during the newborn period, they become more prominent as the infant develops. As these children grow into young adulthood, however, the facial abnormalities become more subtle and thereby contribute to the difficulty of recognizing FAS in older persons. With these physical abnormalities come sensory deficits that frequently involve vision, hearing and speech. Hyperacusis (abnormal acuteness of hearing) is common in infants, and approximately one third of these infants have a conductive hearing loss and another one-third have a sensorineural hearing loss.

            "Sure there is a chance, but it is very unlikely. The bird flyou virus is found in avian feces. The more yoyou come into contact with bird feces, the greater your exposure. But the media has blown bird flyou out of proportion. Only people with intimate contact with birds, in Asia the poor live with chickens in their houses, have gotten it. It is very difficult to spread through the air and it doesn't pass from human to human. The reason why it is so 'news worthy' is that it is a brand new strain no one in history has been exposed to and therefore no one has a natural immunity/resistance to, once yoyou get it your immune system doesn't recognize it and put up a fight. Don't worry about getting a flyou shot. While yoyou can't get the flyou from a flyou shot (a common myth), it won't protect you. The World Health Organization predicts the 3 most common strains every year and combines them in a single shot. Unfortunately these are only predictions, and there are over 3000 strains. Viruses can swap genetic material and do so often. If bird flyou gained the ability to be spread through the air and from person to person then we would have a disaster. Until then, I'd be more worried about the diseases your child will catch from other children.",

The virus is primarily found in avian feces, and the risk increases with greater exposure to bird feces. The media has exaggerated the threat of bird flu, emphasizing that it is more common in regions where people live closely with birds, such as in certain parts of Asia. Bird flyou is challenging to spread through the air and does not typically transmit from human to human. The novelty of new strains makes it newsworthy, as individuals lack natural immunity. Getting a flyou shot is not a guarantee of protection, as the World Health Organization predicts common strains for the annual vaccine, but there are numerous strains. Viruses can exchange genetic material, and if bird flyou gained the ability to spread through the air and between people, it could pose a significant threat. In the U.S., the risk is considered minor, especially if the birds appear healthy."

        "answers": [
            "hey i read this somewher, that matches the symptons here: PFIC (Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis) What is Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) Taken word for word, it means: Progressive: tending to get worse over time; Familial: passed down to a child from the parents by way of the genes; Intrahepatic: involves disease inside the liver and not the bile ducts outside the liver; Cholestasis: means poor bile flow and build-up of substances in the liver that should be put into bile. The symptoms of PFIC FIC1 and BSEP disease cause similar symptoms; together they are called low-GGT PFIC because of a blood test (GGT) that is low rather than high as in most other forms of cholestasis. These diseases cause cholestasis that begins in early childhood, with the average age at onset being 3 months. However, some patients do not get symptoms of cholestasis until they are teenagers or young adults. These diseases can progress quickly to bad scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) in the first year of life or more slowly with minimal scarring well into the teenage years. Few patients have survived beyond 20 years without treatment. Itching (pruritus) is the main symptom of cholestasis in many patients. Pruritus is often out of proportion to the level of jaundice (yellow eyes or skin), which is often low-grade and can wax and wane. Scratching starts as digging at the ears and eyes, which are the first areas to show bleeding and scarring. The itching may be very disabling and does not usually respond to medications. The scratching interferes with normal activities and sleep and may interfere with learning and schoolwork. Problems with growth are another major feature of PFIC. Almost all patients are short for their age, but they may not be thin. Delayed puberty and sexual development is common. Patients who are treated can have normal sexual development and several have given birth to normal children. Other common problems include frequent nosebleeds and wheezing. Fat-soluble vitamin (A, E, D and K) deficiencies are common in untreated patients. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to problems with vision. Vitamin E deficiency can lead to problems with balance, strength and coordination. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to poor bone formation. Vitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding problems. For these reasons, most patients need extra vitamins. Up to a third of patients have gallstones. Most patients have an enlarged liver or enlarged spleen. Although similar, there are differences between patients with BSEP disease and those with FIC1 disease. For example, patients with FIC1 disease are more likely to have watery diarrhea, which can be severe, especially after liver transplantation. However, there is much that we do not yet know about these differences and this will only become clear as more patients are studied. Patients with PFIC but with high serum GGT have been called PFIC3, and are now called MDR3 disease. These patients have very bad cholestasis in the first year of life, which may progress in the first few years of life toward failure of the liver to do its normal functions. However, there are probably less severe forms of MDR3 disease that cause milder disease. The child and his family may first become aware that there is something wrong during school age or adolescence. Sometimes, problems may not appear until adulthood. The full spectrum of liver problems caused by MDR3 disease is just now becoming known."

        "labelled_summary": "Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is a genetic disorder characterized by worsening cholestasis, a condition involving poor bile flow and the accumulation of substances in the liver. PFIC can be categorized as low-GGT PFIC when associated with FIC1 and BSEP diseases, leading to symptoms such as jaundice, itching (pruritus), and liver scarring (cirrhosis). Onset typically occurs in early childhood but can manifest later into adolescence or adulthood. Itching, often disproportionate to jaundice levels, is a prominent symptom and may be resistant to medications. Growth issues, delayed puberty, frequent nosebleeds, and vitamin deficiencies are common. Patients may also experience gallstones, an enlarged liver, and spleen. PFIC3, now referred to as MDR3 disease, involves severe cholestasis in early life and may progress to liver dysfunction. Variations in symptoms exist between FIC1 disease and BSEP disease, and MDR3 disease may present with milder forms. The understanding of these disorders is evolving as more patients are studied."

Addiction is defined as the compulsive need for and use of something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming, characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal; Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent upon a habit forming substance (such as the endorphins caused by throwing up, or the habit forming behavior of bingeing and the fear of gaining weight that leads to purging/laxatives/exercise in bulimia). What matters most is whether or not the substance or behavior causes what we now know to be the essence of addiction: uncontrollable, compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social consequences. Addicts are trapped in their behaviors and cannot simply quit on their own. They have an illness that requires biomedical treatment. People often assume that because addiction begins with a voluntary behavior and is expressed in the form of excess behavior, an addict should just be able to quit by force of will alone. However, it is essential to understand when dealing with addicts that we are dealing with individuals whose brains have been altered by alcohol, drug or behavioral abuse. They need addiction treatment. Today, scientists and physicians overwhelmingly agree that while use and even abuse of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine is a behavior over which the individual exerts control, addiction to these substances is something different. Scientists have begun to understand why addicted people may sacrifice everything that's important to them -- their jobs, their families, their homes -- in the quest for a fix. Best, `k.",

Contrary to the misconception that addicts can quit through sheer willpower.

            "How Soon Can Yoyou Expect to See Results? The Most Frequently Asked Question of Any Beginner Do yoyou ever wonder why so many people join a gym in January and then it\u2019s business as usual the end of February or mid-March? There\u2019s a couple of reasons. First, working out is something yoyou do as a habit. Not just something yoyou do for four weeks. Many of the people, who join up, have no idea what\u2019s going on. They just sign up. Hand over a year\u2019s worth of dues and get on a machine. The lucky ones get a 30 minute overview of the gym with a personal trainer. And maybe the trainer is good. And maybe not. They have somewhat of a goal. Lose weight. Get bigger. And they don\u2019t have any idea of what their body can do. After about 4-8 weeks of this, it\u2019s old. Not exciting anymore. They don\u2019t really like exercising anyway. Now going to the gym is a chore that ranks with paying bills. The excuses start (have to work late, pick up the kids, my <insert body part> hurts, I\u2019m tired) and it\u2019s over. Second, if yoyou don\u2019t see results fast and I mean FAST, it\u2019s over. If yoyou don\u2019t lose 60 lbs in 4 weeks, then working out has failed you. If yoyou didn\u2019t gain 40 lbs of muscle in a month, then yoyou are a hardgainer and will be doomed to lead the life of a skinny guy forever. There\u2019s a whole group of people that want to obtain a certain body image. But 16 years is way to long. They want to be slim and trim or big and buff in 2 months for some occasion. Or maybe they saw all the ads over the holidays, looked at themselves and said, yeah why not. I\u2019ll just join a gym. Fitness is easy. Nothing to it. I\u2019ll do a little here and there. I\u2019ll do cardio. I\u2019ll quit eating. They quit too. So just how soon can yoyou expect to see results? On average, if yoyou change your diet, follow a moderate to intense routine and introduce some interval training cardio, yoyou will see results in as little as 4-6 weeks. Nothing earth shattering mind yoyou but changes. Slow progress. Yoyou might even start to feel internal body changes within a week. The key to getting the results yoyou want as fast as possible is to monitor where yoyou are now, where yoyou want to be then and what yoyou are going to do daily to get there. Those that think results only come at the gym really never see results. And they quit. Those that understand fitness is 24x7x365, will see results in 4-6 weeks. When yoyou wake up and eat breakfast or don\u2019t eat, that is fitness. When yoyou consistently don\u2019t get the rest yoyou need, that is affecting your goals. When yoyou have no way to measure progress, it\u2019s very difficult to tell if yoyou are going anywhere at all. Just because yoyou cannot \u201csee\u201d something does not mean it\u2019s not there. Every time yoyou pick up a weight or get on the cardio machine, jog or run, yoyou are making changes in your body. Yoyou might not see it but I bet yoyou can feel it. Bottom line, there\u2019s no magical number of when yoyou might see some progress of your efforts but on average, in four to six weeks yoyou can begin to see your efforts pay off if yoyou understand that fitness is a lifestyle and not just another diet or thing yoyou do when yoyou have the time."

It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen. From webmd: Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition. In scleroderma, the skin gradually tightens and thickens or hardens. It loses its ability to stretch.

However be safe for see a doctor and get it checked. This is not something to wait on. PAGET'S DISEASE: Introduction: Paget's disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer in which the first clinical finding is usually scaling of the nipple skin. It may also be associated with nipple redness and burning. The diagnosis of this condition is typically made with a skin biopsy, which shows cells typical of this condition (Paget's cells). The \"good news\" about Paget's disease is that it is usually a \"curable cancer\". However, most cases of scaling and burning of the nipple are due to benign conditions which can be easily confused with Paget's disease. Making the Diagnosis: The major goal of this section is to help women (and their physicians) detect the early nipple changes associated with Paget's disease, and to help differentiate them from benign conditions. Making the diagnosis of Paget's disease is actually quite easy. We use a simple skin punch biopsy technique to remove a small piece of tissue from the area of the nipple with the abnormal changes. This procedure takes a few minutes to perform under local anesthesia and is painless. A small amount of skin and underlying tissues is removed and sent to the pathologist. In our experience with hundreds of cases it has proven to be 100% accurate. The first step in evaluating any patient with a change in the skin of the nipple is to obtain a careful history and to perform a careful breast examination, followed by a diagnostic mammogram. When performing a diagnostic mammogram the mammographer is informed about the posibility Paget's disease. Special films look for fine calcifications behind the nipple. If the mammogram is negative and our clinical suspicion is low, we usually suggest that the patient place a cortisone cream on the nipple for two weeks. If the condition has not responded completely to treatment in two weeks, we proceed to a skin punch biopsy. (a word of caution: we have seen cases of Paget's disease in which the mammogram was negative. The patient seemed to respond to treatment, but nipple changes recurred again in a few months. Therefore if a biopsy is not done, careful follow-up is recommended). Our rule of thumb: if in doubt, do a skin biopsy.",

        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, at 34 weeks, a pregnancy is still considered pre-term, posing potential risks to both the mother and baby. Premature birth at this stage may lead to underdeveloped lungs in the baby, as the production of surfactant, crucial for lung function, might not be sufficient. Testing for surfactant levels and administering drugs to prevent premature labor are common interventions. While the absence of surfactant can result in Respiratory Distress Syndrome, there are surfactant replacement therapies available for treatment. It is essential to address the underlying causes of pre-term labor and closely monitor both maternal and fetal well-being during this critical period."

        "question": "Is there a home remedy to detox from nicotine ?",
        "answers": [
            "I found this - I hope it helps! The Recovery Process Successful nicotine dependency recovery is in maintaining the motivations, dreams and patience needed to allow: (1) the physical mind time to re-sensitize itself and re-adjust to functioning normally again; (2) the subconscious mind time to encounter and re-condition the bulk of its nicotine feeding cues that triggered brief anxiety episodes in an attempt to gain compliance; and (3) the conscious mind time to either allow years of defensive dependency rationalizations to fade into distant memory, or the intelligent quitter time to more rapidly destroy their impact through honest reflection. The ex-smoker will find themselves enjoying a deep and rich sense of inner quiet, calmness, and tranquility once their temporary journey of re-adjustment is substantially complete. The body's nicotine reserves decline by about half every two hours. It's not only the basic chemical half-life clock which determines mandatory nicotine feeding times, when quitting it's also the clock that determines how long it takes before the brain begins bathing in nicotine free blood-serum, the moment that real healing begins. It can take up to 72 hours for the blood-serum to become nicotine-free and 90% of nicotine's metabolites to exit the body via your urine. It's then that the anxieties associated with readjustment normally peak in intensity and begin to gradually decline. But just one powerful \"hit\" of nicotine and you\u2019ll again face another 72 hours of detox anxieties. It's why the one puff survival rate is almost zero. None of us are stronger than nicotine but then we don\u2019t need to be as it is simply a chemical with an I.Q. of zero. It does not plot, plan or conspire and is not some demon within us. Our most effective weapon against it is, and always has been, our vastly superior intelligence but only if put to work. Nicotine Replacement Products The key to nicotine dependency recovery is not in dragging out the 72 hours of detox by toying for weeks or months with gradual nicotine weaning or other creative means for delivering nicotine. The nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) industry want smokers to believe that a natural poison is medicine, that its use is therapy, and that it is somehow different from the tobacco plant's nicotine molecule. The truth is that the pharmaceutical industry buys its nicotiana from the exact same growers as the tobacco industry. They want yoyou to believe that double-blind placebo controlled studies proved that NRT doubles a cold turkey quitters odds of quitting and that only superheros can quit without it. The truth is that their studies were not blind as claimed, and that all but a tiny sliver of earth's successful quitters are quitting entirely on their own. Here are a few facts that those selling creative nicotine delivery devices would rather yoyou not know: Nicotine is a psychoactive drug whose \"high\" provides a dopamine \"aaahhh\" sensation and an adrenaline rush. Would yoyou have been able to tell, within 5 minutes, whether the gum or lozenge you'd been given contained the nicotine equilivent of smoking two cigarettes or was instead a nicotine-free placebo? So could they. A 2004 study found that NRT studies suffered from massive wide-spread blinding failures (May 2004) A nicotine smoker's natural odds of quitting for six months, entirely on their own, without any products, procedures, education programs, counseling or formal support is roughly 10% (June 2000) Those using the over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine patch or gum as a stand-alone quitting tool have only a 7% chance of quitting smoking for six months (March 2003) Up to 7% of OTC nicotine gum quitters are still chronic users of nicotine gum at six months (May 2004). Question: isn't 7 minus 7 still zero? (May 2004) 36.6% of all current nicotine gum users are chronic long-term users (May 2004) Yoyou tr",
            "Short answer? 1. Stay off nicotine - there are plenty of methods to stop the addiction, but pick one. 2. Fill your system with good stuff: clear air and healthy food. Do this by taking deep breaths and exhaling completely, and eating only healthy foods (including snacks) for at least a week. 3. Get plenty of vitamin C, which is supposed to specifically help yoyou rid yourself of nicotine. Take some vitamin C tablets and/or foods with vitamin C. As with any vitamin, don't overdose."

        "labelled_summary": "To overcome nicotine addiction, it is essential to give the mind sufficient time for re-sensitization and re-adjustment. This involves giving the mind time to encounter and re-condition the cues associated with nicotine feeding, which often causes anxiety episodes. Additionally, the conscious mind needs time to let go of defensive dependency rationalizations that may have been built up over the years. The body's nicotine reserves, decline by about half every two hours. The process of nicotine detoxification relies on the time it takes for the brain to bathe in nicotine-free blood-serum, signaling the beginning of real healing. This usually occurs within 72 hours, during which nicotine's metabolites exit the body via urine. It is crucial to be aware that even a single powerful \"hit\" of nicotine can reset the detoxification process, leading to another 72 hours of detox anxieties. There exists a need for complete abstinence from any source of nicotine Nicotine is a psychoactive drug that induces a \"high\" by providing dopamine and adrenaline rushes. While Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products like patches and gum are available, studies have shown limited success, with a natural quitting rate of approximately 10%. Stand-alone use of over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine patch or gum yields a mere 7% success rate for a six-month cessation. Notably, there are challenges with NRT studies as they are marred with conflict of interests. Furthermore, a significant percentage of OTC nicotine gum quitters continue to be chronic users at the six-month mark, and a substantial portion of all current nicotine gum users are identified as chronic long-term users."

Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where yoyou need it can be under-treated. Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if yoyou start raising the dosage. There is a solution- topical administration. Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream. It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine). Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded. Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that yoyou can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems. Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs. Yoyou may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. When yoyou apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes. This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area. Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.

I've been trying to convince her that filling her life with more waste of space guys are not the way to being less lonely, especially since the guys she's attracted to have no life. I'll tell yoyou what I told her. Finish high school. Then take some college courses. Get a job. In between times, surround yourself with a healthy circle of friends...ones that aren't after yoyou for money, a place to sleep, or smokes. Find other young mom's who are doing the same thing. Find a MOPS group...Mother's Of Pre-schoolers. It's a mother's group, who meet regularly (weekly) and get together with their children, sharing tips, recipes, cleaning ideas, and each others problems. Once a month, they hire a babysitter and do something together, like go to a movie, bowling or a number of other fun, wholesome activities. Getting involved with a volunteer organization will get yoyou out of the house and helping others with bigger needs than yours. If your child is old enough (as young as 3), yoyou can enroll them in Headstart. There are lots of activities for the parent to get involved with there, along with being with other parents who are going through some of the same things. Some people will find an grandmother-type person, who is still very active, and yoyou help each other. She can help yoyou with your child, being a surrogate grandma, and she can teach yoyou what she knows. Yoyou can help her with some of the chores that are maybe a little difficult for her. The thing is to do something with your life that's meaningful to yoyou and your child. When yoyou get involved, yoyou teach yourself and yoyou teach your child, and you'll end up showing your child how to give of himself to those less fortunate. <*)))><",

        "question": "Are teeth capable of replacing worn enamel?",
        "answers": [
            "No. Our teeth (I'm referring to humans) are brachydont; that is, they only grow for a limited period and afterwards the roots of the tooth become closed. This means that there will be no new materials added, and they will become more and more worn. However, enamel is the hardest tissue in our entire bodies, so normally it doesn't wear off completely during a lifetime. Other mammals have ever-growing teeth; in that case both enamel and dentine are replaced constantly. _________________ Streamcat, I hope you're joking. And I thought the question referred to a natural process. Of course dentists can replace enamel with synthetic materials. ----------------- Can certain animals grow new enamel? Yes, but not in the sense of \"repairing\" their teeth. It's more simple than that: the distal part of the tooth (the functional end) is continually being worn, and the new tissues arise from the basal parts. Those are hypsodont teeth (as rodent incisors and the molars of many herbivores). If yoyou get the chance to examine a rodent skull, you'll see that their incisors don't really have roots, they look like long curved cylinders with an open base.",
            "How do those animals do that? If we are smarter than animals should'nt we be able to figure out how to do that? The apical foramen may be small, but its not closed. Fillings are just a patch, I would'nt consider them to replace enamel.",
            "Let's say there is carious lesion on the surface of a tooth. If it is deep into the dentin, then there's no going back. However, if the lesion is just on the surface of the enamel, it can be restored.",

        "labelled_summary": "No, human teeth cannot grow new enamel. Our teeth are brachydont, meaning they only grow for a limited period, and the roots eventually close. The enamel on human teeth does not regenerate or grow back. Once the enamel is worn or damaged, it cannot be naturally replaced. Dentists can use synthetic materials for enamel replacement or restore teeth with fillings, but this is not a natural growth process. Some other animals, like rodents and certain herbivores, have ever-growing teeth (hypsodont teeth) where new tissues continuously replace the worn parts."

While breastfeeding, your body uses about 500 calories a day to make milk for baby. The most important thing for yoyou is to make sure the foods yoyou are eating are 80-90 % healthy (like during pregnancy). If yoyou eat junk, your baby will still get good milk, but your body will suffer because yoyou will not get the vitamens and minerals yoyou need. As far as exercise goes, if yoyou haven't been exercising, start slowly. And remember, it took 9 months to put the weight on -- it will likely take 9 months to take it off."

        "labelled_summary": "Breastfeeding offers the advantage of burning an extra 300-500 calories daily, but certain precautions should be taken. While engaging in any comfortable postpartum exercise is generally acceptable, weight loss pills or supplements may pose risks as they could pass through breast milk to the baby. Although losing weight during breastfeeding can be challenging, it is possible through a combination of calorie reduction and increased exercise. The process may take time, often extending until weaning, but it is essential to prioritize a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals for both the mother and the baby's well-being. Starting exercise gradually and maintaining patience, considering the nine-month timeline, is crucial for sustainable weight loss."

            "it replaces one of the valves in your heart (which function to move the blood to the rest of the body from the heart) to improve blood flow.",
            "The aortic valve is the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta. This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body. There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart. There are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves. Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile. The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life. Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients. However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life. There is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure. This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve. The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve. The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve. The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable. In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation. Current cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices.",
            "The aortic valve is a semilunar valve that controls blood flow from the left ventricle to the systemic system of the body.. Its only job is to close so that backflow of blood back to the left ventricle will not be attained.. If the valve is not functioning properly the person's diastolic pressure will increase which will ultimately cause a cardiac infarction. The actual replacement can be achieved, but it is a very delicate surgery because the aorta is the biggest blood vessel in the body. Usually an aortic bypass is performed."

        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, the aortic valve serves as the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta, facilitating the flow of fresh oxygenated blood throughout the body. Diseases such as aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency may necessitate the replacement of this valve. There are two primary types of aortic valve replacements: mechanical valves, which have a well-established safety record but require lifelong blood thinners, and biologic/tissue valves, which eliminate the need for blood thinners but may have lower durability. The Ross procedure presents a variation, replacing the aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve and using a tissue valve for the pulmonary position. This approach minimizes strain on the aortic valve and avoids the need for postoperative blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive catheter-based methods for valve replacement. Proper functioning of the aortic valve is crucial to prevent complications such as increased diastolic pressure and the risk of cardiac infarction. Aortic bypass surgery is often performed to address a malfunctioning aortic valve, acknowledging the complexity of the procedure due to the aorta's significance as the body's largest blood vessel."

        "answers": [
            "There is often some confusion on the difference between gallstones and kidney stones. Kidney stones form in urine in the kidneys (redundant, I know, but hang in there). They are most commonly calcium oxalate (but calcium doesn't cause the stones!). In order for them to be passed without surgery, they have to go through the ureters to the urine bladder, and then through the urethra to exit the body. Gallstones are formed in the gall bladder which stores bile created by the liver. They are most commonly formed of cholesterol. The gall bladder pumps bile into the top of the small intestine, where it helps digest fats and fat soluble vitamins. And here's the big difference. If a gallstone actually makes it out of the gallbladder, it will enter the small intestines and leave the body in feces. The bile duct, btw, is normally about 4mm but may go up to 7mm if there are lodged stones. Now consider what someone who is claiming that their solution will allow gallstones to pass the body (with pictures!) is supposedly doing to find these gallstones. (And because I can't resist a good line) If yoyou pee it out, it's a kidney stone, if yoyou poop it out it's a gallstone. Now, having said all of that, I see that the Mayo clinic does have a sound wave treatment for gallstones, but they indicate that it is appropriate for only a small number of cases. And that the gallstones will come back on yoyou unless yoyou take a special medicine for the rest of your life. Yoyou can try to control your gallstones by eating a very low fat, cholesterol controlling diet. This might keep the stones from getting larger. However, yoyou will need to keep an eye on them, as they can get large enough to cause more serious problems than pain.",

Nicotine use makes tinnitus worse by reducing blood flow to the structures of the ear. -Limit your use of aspirin, products containing aspirin, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen. -Exercise regularly. Exercise improves blood flow to the structures of the ear. However, avoid extended periods of exercise, such as bicycle riding, that keep your neck in a hyperextended position. For more information, see the topic Fitness. While waiting to see whether tinnitus goes away, or if your health professional has advised yoyou that your tinnitus will be present for a long time, try these methods to cope with the constant noise: -Limit or avoid exposure to the noises yoyou suspect are causing your tinnitus. If yoyou cannot avoid loud noises, wear protective earplugs or earmuffs. -Try to ignore the sound by directing your attention to other things. -Practice relaxation techniques, such as biofeedback, meditation, or yoga. Stress and fatigue seem to make tinnitus worse. -Quiet rooms can cause tinnitus to seem more distracting. Background noise may reduce the amount of noise yoyou hear. Play music or white noise when yoyou are trying to fall asleep or anytime yoyou find yourself in a quiet place. Yoyou may consider buying a machine that makes soothing sounds, such as ocean waves. -Try the herbal supplement ginkgo biloba.

            "PROPERTIES OF AFLATOXIN AND IT PRODUCING FUNGI Reddy,S.V. and Farid Waliyar -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Many agricultural commodities are vulnerable to attack by a group of fungi that are able to produce toxic metabolites called mycotoxins. Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as \"Turkey 'X' Disease\" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins. Natural occurrence: Food products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. Physical and chemical properties: Aflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins.",
            "Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus; but most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals, including humans. After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to an intermediate reactive, aflatoxin M1, an epoxide.",

Acne Treatment |Self-Care at Home| * Wash once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil from the skin. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter in any drug store can also be helpful. Avoid scrubbing too abrasively because this can actually irritate the skin and cause acne to worsen. * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product. * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne. * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne. |Medical Treatment| Many treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor. * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers. o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes. o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles. * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications. o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne. + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender. + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a \"bad sunburn\" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth. o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads). + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil. + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome",

            "Dandruff is thought to be caused by a form of a skin condition called eczema, which causes increased shedding of normal scalp skin cells. Hormonal or seasonal changes may make dandruff worse. Here are some tips. Learn to manage stress. Stress affects your overall health, making yoyou susceptible to a number of conditions and diseases. It can even help trigger dandruff or exacerbate existing symptoms. Shampoo often. If yoyou tend to have an oily scalp, daily shampooing to remove the excess oil may help prevent dandruff. Cut back on styling products. Hair sprays, styling gels, mousses and hair waxes can all build up on your hair and scalp, making them oilier. Some people may even develop allergies to various hair-care products. Eat a healthy diet. For overall good health, include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and small amounts of lean protein in your diet. Get a little sun. Sunlight may be good for dandruff. But because exposure to ultraviolet light damages your skin and increases your risk of skin cancer, don't sunbathe. Instead, just spend a little time outdoors. But wear sunscreen on your face and body.",
