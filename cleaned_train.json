        "answers": [
            "Perimenopause (and later, menopause itself) is not an illness, but a natural process in a woman\u2019s body. Your symptoms, like night sweats, irregular periods, vaginal dryness, and menopause insomnia, are just indicators of underlying hormonal imbalances or metabolic damage from poor nutrition, stress and other factors. Menopause: * Irregular periods. Your menstrual periods may stop suddenly, or gradually get lighter or heavier and then stop. The unpredictability of your periods may be your first clue that menopause is approaching. * Decreased fertility. When ovulation begins to fluctuate, you're less likely to become pregnant. Until yoyou haven't had a period for a year, however, pregnancy is still possible. * Vaginal and urinary changes. As your estrogen level declines, the tissues lining your vagina and urethra \u2014 the opening to your bladder \u2014 become drier, thinner and less elastic. With decreased lubrication yoyou may experience burning or itching, along with increased risk of infections of your urinary tract or vagina. These changes may make sexual intercourse uncomfortable or even painful. Yoyou may feel the need to urinate more frequently or more urgently, and yoyou may experience urinary incontinence. * Hot flashes. As your estrogen level drops, your blood vessels may expand rapidly, causing your skin temperature to rise. This can lead to a feeling of warmth that moves upward from your chest to your shoulders, neck and head. Yoyou may sweat, and as the sweat evaporates from your skin, yoyou may feel chilled, weak and slightly faint. Your face might look flushed, and red blotches may appear on your chest, neck and arms. Most hot flashes last from 30 seconds to several minutes, although they can last much longer. The frequency, as well as the duration, of hot flashes varies from person to person. Yoyou may have them once every hour or only occasionally. They can occur any time during the day or night. They may be a part of your life for a year or more, or yoyou may never have them. * Sleep disturbances and night sweats. Night sweats are often a consequence of hot flashes. Yoyou may awaken from a sound sleep with soaking night sweats followed by chills. Yoyou may have difficulty falling back to sleep or achieving a deep, restful sleep. Lack of sleep may affect your mood and overall health. * Changes in appearance. Many women gain a modest amount of weight \u2014 about 5 pounds on average \u2014 during the menopausal transition. The fat that once was concentrated in your hips and thighs may settle above your waist and in your abdomen. Yoyou may notice a loss of fullness in your breasts, thinning hair and wrinkles in your skin. If yoyou previously experienced adult acne, it may become worse. Although your estrogen level drops, your body continues to produce small amounts of the male hormone testosterone. As a result, yoyou may develop coarse hair on your chin, upper lip, chest and abdomen. * Emotional and cognitive changes. Yoyou may experience irritability, fatigue, decreased memory and diminished concentration as yoyou approach menopause. These symptoms have sometimes been attributed to hormonal fluctuations. Yet other factors are more likely to contribute to these changes, including sleep deprivation and stressful life events \u2014 such as the illness or death of a parent, grown children leaving home or returning home, and retirement.",

            "If yoyou test positive for chlamydia, your infection can be cured with antibiotics. Depending on several factors, your health care professional may prescribe azithromycin, in which case yoyou will take only a single dose, or yoyou may be prescribed doxycycline, which requires one pill twice a day for seven days. This may be followed by a test to see if yoyou are cured, but test of cure is not routine and is usually reserved for pregnant women or individuals with persisting or new symptoms. Penicillin is not considered as effective against chlamydia as azithromycin. If yoyou are pregnant and infected with chlamydia, yoyou still can be treated without harming the fetus. However, doxycycline is not recommended for pregnant women. The recommended regimen for pregnant women is erythromycin or amoxicillin for seven days, yet azithromycin as a single dose is also a possible option and recent studies and expert opinions suggest it is safe and effective. As with any antibiotic treatment, it is important that yoyou take all your pills, even after symptoms disappear. Because treatment with doxycycline or azithromycin is highly effective, women usually do not need retesting for chlamydia after treatment unless their symptoms persist or reinfection is suspected. Too often, women become reinfected because their partner has not been treated as well. Studies have shown that women who are reinfected with chlamydia have a much greater risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Therefore, it is important that yoyou abstain from sexual contact until your partner has been tested and completed treatment, meaning seven days after a single-dose azithromycin regimen or after completion of a seven-day doxycycline regimen. In general, treatment is recommended for any partner or partners yoyou had sexual contact with up to 60 days prior to having symptoms or a diagnosis of chlamydia. Some clinics are experimenting with what is called partner-delivered therapy. Patients are given a one-gram dose of azithromycin to give to their partner. There are legal and ethical debates about this approach but in some cases it may be the most effective way to stop the spread of chlamydia, because many infected male partners have no symptoms and are reluctant to seek treatment. Penicillin is not considered as effective against chlamydia as azithromycin or doxycycline. PID treatment begins with an antibiotic regimen that provides broad coverage against several different bacteria. Treatment should begin as soon as a diagnosis is made, because immediate therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of long-term consequences of PID. Studies are under way to determine whether oral therapy is as effective as parenteral (intravenous) therapy. There are several different treatment options recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Regardless of which type of therapy is chosen, hospitalization is no longer recommended, except in certain circumstances including: surgery is needed the patient is pregnant an oral outpatient regimen cannot be tolerated a patient does not respond clinically to oral antimicrobial therapy a patient has severe illness, including high fever, nausea and vomiting a patient has tubo-ovarian abscess or a weakened immune system While medication can stop PID, some women may need surgery to remove scar tissue and blockages caused by long-term infection. The most common type of surgery involves laparoscopy.",

            "Hey here hope this helps, this is from the source, check out the full article. \"scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the National Institutes of Health, have shown that exposure to cold temperatures does not influence the development or severity of a cold. This means that if a person is exposed to a cold virus but isn't necessarily showing symptoms, exposure to cold temperature doesn't make a difference as to whether this person gets sick or how sick this person will become. Still, most colds occur during the fall and winter months, when schools begin to open and the mercury begins to fall. While cold temperatures do not cause colds, the colder months of the year seem to be more conducive to infection or transmission. This is probably due to many factors, including: >lower humidity >schools are in session >people spend more time indoors and in closer quarters >The cold season corresponds to the colder months of the year, which are also those with lower humidity. This absence of moisture may affect the number of infections as the most common cold-causing viruses thrive in lower humidity. What's more, dry air can dry the mucous lining of the nasal passages, making it more open to viral infection.\"",
            "Going out into the cold weather has no effect on the spread of a cold. The reason that there appears to be a relationship is that people spend more time indoors during the cold winter weather. In fact, however, it is the proximity to other people rather than the temperature outside that seems to be the culprit. For this same reason, children in daycare or kindergarten are particularly prone to having colds.",

Also, Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro. Try eliminating Monsodium Glutamate from your diet.

            "Ear candles are a scam. The way it's described as working is pure bull. It's supposed to work by creating a gentle vacuum to pull out any wax in your ears. Yes, a flame will create a vacuum, but not if it's open to air. It needs to be enclosed. If yoyou enclose an ear candle, you'll end up popping your eardrum. Please try these experiments. Take a large sandwich bag and blow it up with your mouth so that it looks like a balloon. Now use your mouth to suck out all the air. That's what a collapsed bag looks like. Remember what it looks like. Now blow up the bag again. Put the small end of the candle into the bag's opening and light the candle. If it's supposed to create a vacuum effect, the plastic bag should completely collapse like when yoyou sucked out the air with your mouth. Do yoyou get the same effect? I didn't think so. As for removing excess wax from your ears, the stuff yoyou see at the bottom of the candle is not ear wax. It's just the ash from the candle. If yoyou don't believe me, try candling your ear and see how much material comes out. Next, put one of those ear candles into a cup and burn it. You'll notice that the same amount of material will show up at the bottom of the candle. Are yoyou telling me that the candle pulled ear wax out of a cup? The candles work through a psychosomatic effect. It's similar to someone taking a sugar pill and actually feeling better because they believe it. I suppose the heat would also make your ears feel better, but it's not a real solution if yoyou have an ear infection or other disease. Don't waste your money. If your ear hurts, see a doctor. It could be an ear infection. If yoyou have excess wax, go to your local pharmacy and pick up some ear wax removal drops.",

During the REM cycle, the muscles of the body are paralysed including the muscles that control the flow of blood to the penis. In the early part of the night, the REM periods are shorter, but they get longer as the night progresses. Most people are in close proximity to a very long REM period when they wake up in the morning with an erection. Typically, it is normal to get an erection roughly 3 times every night during a full 8 hour sleep.

            "Fifth's disease, or erythema infectiosa, has been recognized much more in the past few years. We now know that it is caused by the human parvo virus B19-3. It is called Fifth's disease after four more common viral rash illnesses seen in children which are measles, scarlet fever, rubella and scarlatina. The Sixth's disease is roseola. Fifth's disease virus, or human parvo virus B19, is attracted to rapidly dividing cells in the body. Therefore people with weak immune systems and with weak red blood cells are at high risk. This includes people with sickle cell disease, hereditary spirochaetosis, any serious immune disease or cancer, and AIDS. It also might include someone with recurrent blood loss and anemia. In these patients, a very severe with profound anemia and a very severe disease without the typical rash. These patients obviously need the care of an experienced physician and frequently a hematologist. For the majority of patients, however, Fifths disease is a mild viral infection which starts with typical cold like symptoms in adults and sometimes vague muscle aches and headache. This is the time in which the patient is actually contagious and the virus is multiplying in the body. After a few days, the virus clears and antibodies to the virus cause a classic rash in the skin. In adults, there is usually some joint swelling and tenderness. In children the rash is a slightly raised, bright red patch over the facial cheeks with some clearing directly around the mouth. Also present is a lacy pink to red rash scattered over the extremities and trunk. Usually palms and soles are spared. About 50% of the time, the rash itches. The rash seems to fade and come back whenever the child is stressed or exposed to a lot of sun or overheating. In older adolescents and adults, the rash may not appear as the typical rash seen in children. The predominant symptoms seen in up to 60% of adults is joint swelling usually the wrist, hands or ankles. This may last for up to a few weeks but does not cause any permanent changes and does not cause rheumatoid arthritis. The joint symptoms are only found in about 3% of children up to age nine. Again, most children will acquire Fifth's disease at some time in their life and most adults, when tested for antibodies show evidence of having had it sometime in their life. The risk to a pregnant woman is considered about .6% and should be taken into account since a growing fetus does have both a weak immune system and rapidly dividing red cells and is, therefore, susceptible to the virus. It is not recommended that children with Fifth's disease be excluded from school because by the time the rash appears, they are actually not contagious. It is also not recommended that pregnant women be excluded from day care or other work situations because of the relative low risk to them. They should be aware, however, of any epidemics taking place and use good hand washing as a means of decreasing the spread of the virus. There is presently no vaccine but there is some experimental evidence that IV gamma globulin may help in high risk patients; however it is not presently recommended for routine patients. Infants of mothers who contract parvo virus B19 in early pregnancy are at risk for severe blood loss but do not develop birth defects. In cases where the diagnosis is picked up there have been fetal blood exchanges done and the infants have been saved through this procedure. Obviously this is something that would require a sophisticated medical center and a team of perinatologists and obstetrician.",

            "I assume yoyou are talking about something like Pancrease which is a pill that contains the normal proteolytic enzymes that are released by your pancreas to aid in digestion. They cleave bonds in protein to make more simple molecules that your intestines can absorb and are usually prescribed for people that have inadequate pancreas function.",
            "Proteases (proteinases, peptidases or proteolytic enzymes) are enzymes that break peptide bonds between amino acids of proteins. The process is called proteolytic cleavage, a common mechanism of activation or inactivation of enzymes especially involved in blood coagulation or digestion. They use a molecule of water for this and are thus classified as hydrolases. Classification There are currently six classes of proteases: Serine proteases Threonine proteases Cysteine proteases Aspartic acid proteases (e. g. plasmepsin) Metalloproteases Glutamic acid proteases The threonine and glutamic peptidases were not described until 1995 and 2004, respectively. The mechanism used to cleave a peptide bond involves making an amino acid residue (serine, cystein and threonine peptidases) or a water molecule (aspartic, metallo and glutamic peptidases) nucleophilic so that it can attack the peptide carbonyl group. One way to make a nucleophile is by a catalytic triad, where a histidine residue is used to activate serine, cysteine or threonine as a nucleophile. Occurrence Proteases occur naturally in all organisms and constitute 1-5% of the gene content. These enzymes are involved in a multitude of physiological reactions from simple digestion of food proteins to highly regulated cascades (e.g. the blood clotting cascade, the complement system and the invertebrate prophenoloxidase activating cascade). Peptidases can break either specific peptide bonds (limited proteolysis), depending on the amino acid sequence of a protein, or break down a complete peptide to amino acids (unlimited proteolysis). The activity can be a destructive change abolishing a protein's function or digesting it to its principal components, it can be an activation of a function or it can be a signal in a signalling pathway."

            "The most common scenario is the pediatrician detecting a \"hip click\" during routine post-natal checkup. Actually, a \"clunk\", rather than a \"click\" is detected in the unstable hip, but it requires experience to tell a \"clunk\" from a \"click\". The pediatrician typically does the Ortolani test by spreading the thighs, or the Barlow test by bringing the knees together, to elicit this finding. In the older infant, the pediatrician may suspect the problem if the child has tight hip adductors - he has a hard time spreading the baby\u2019s hips. He may also notice that the skin creases around the groin or the buttocks are not symmetrical. Or the legs may appear to be of different lengths. At age one, the affected child may present with a limp. Unfortunately, pain is not a problem in the child, hence it is easy to miss the diagnosis. However, by the time the patient becomes an adult, arthritic changes will occur, and pain will set in.",

Out the doot to take her home, they spread her legs for the hip test and sure enough they were dislocated. As soon as she got her brace on she stopped screaming and was no longer in pain!

Signs in older infants may include tight hip adductors or asymmetrical skin creases around the groin or buttocks. By age one, the child may present with a limp, though pain is not typically a symptom. If untreated, arthritic changes may occur in adulthood, leading to pain. Hip dysplasia is more prevalent in certain populations, such as the Lapps and American Indian races, and is more common in first-borns and girls. Genetic factors play a significant role, and breech births, especially with feet up by the shoulders, may contribute. Swaddling and using cradleboards for restraining infants could also be associated with hip dysplasia, occurring in approximately 4 out of 1000 births."

On the other hand a little stress is good for you. Exercise is a form of stress that keeps yoyou fit. Mental stress (Will I fail?) may inspire yoyou to study hard and survive the test. Stress often involves the human fight and flight reaction, releasing lots of adrenalin (ever feel the hairs on your neck rise - perhaps a barking dog right behind you? in a dark alley?). Ancient man had to tackle a different set of problems than we do today. Do I stand and fight the saber-toothed tiger or flee? Adrenalin helped with either decision (but not much with the tiger battle). A great deal of activity, kicking or running, then burned off the excess adrenalin. Today, when we get angry say at a red traffic light, we build up the adrenalin but just sit there and steem without burning it off. And that can harm the cardiovascular system (which includes the heart). Yoyou have a choice. Either sit there shaking your fist fuming at a tiny red light filament and destroy your otherwise perfect body - or - say \"I've been good and I deserve this 90 second break,\" taking your whitened fists off the steering wheel while relaxing and breething deeply. Either way, it's your heart. Good luck.",

But this is more \"sexually reactive\" behaviors...they are reactive to what's happened to them versus being \"predators\" or an \"offender\" in the true sense of the word. Most importantly, with early interventions with a therapist who has EXPERIENCE working with children who've been sexually abused...all children, male or female, can become SURVIVORS who will live happy, healthy, productive lives.

The belly button serves no function post-gestation. Just inside it is a ligament that attaches near the bladder, originally a bundle of blood vessels passing through the umbilicus. After birth, these vessels close up, forming a ligament."

Aspartame is the basis of NutraSweet and Equal, flavors Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi, and other drinks, and sweetens a host of foods yoyou or I wouldn\u2019t even begin to suspect. The email, together with a number of websites, credits the artificial sweetener with nearly every woe known to humankind, from MS to Gulf War syndrome. In the words of the letter: \"If yoyou are using aspartame ... and yoyou suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms, spasms, shooting pains, numbness in your legs, cramps, vertigo, dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, joint pain, depression, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory loss - yoyou probably have aspartame disease.\" \"Yoyou probably have aspartame disease\" is a gross overstatement, but so is the term \"urban legend\" loosely bandied about in various pro-aspartame articles on a number of websites, at least one industry-sponsored. The scientific evidence may fall well short of pinning an actual rap on the sweetener, but it is sufficient enough to raise a legitimate concern. What We Know About Aspartame Three byproducts of aspartame are methanol, formaldehyde, and formate, which defenders maintain occur in modest amounts - similar to what is found in fruit juices - and cannot be considered toxic. But according to Michael Schachter MD in an article on HealthWorld, the methanol in juices is chemically bound so it cannot be absorbed into the body whereas in aspartame it is in a free state where it can be absorbed. Additionally, in aspartame the methanol is unaccompanied by ethanol which acts as a protectant in its natural state. A Medline search reveals divided opinion over whether aspartame consumption can lead to worrisome build-ups of blood methanol or formaldehyde. A 1998 Spanish study on rats, for example, warns \"that aspartame consumption may constitute a hazard because of its contribution to the formation of formaldehyde adducts,\" while a 2002 Japanese study on rats concludes: \"It is suggested that aspartame at abuse doses is harmless to humans.\" A survey of aspartame studies by Ralph Walton MD of Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine found: \"Of the 166 studies felt to have relevance for questions of human safety, 74 had NutraSweet industry related funding and 92 were independently funded. One hundred percent of the industry funded research attested to aspartame's safety, whereas 92 percent of the independently funded research identified a problem.\" One in 15,000 people may not properly metabolize phenylalanine, an essential amino acid found in aspartame. The substance is a precursor to tyrosine, a building block of norepinephrine and dopamine, but, in the words of the FDA: \"High levels of this amino acid in body fluids can cause brain damage.\" Accordingly, the FDA duly requires a warning that all products containing the sweetener be labeled for the substance. Newborns are routinely screened for phenylalanine metabolism (the PKU test), which rules out the likelihood of an unsuspecting consumer gulping down hemlock. The FDA approved aspartame for use in certain dry foods in 1981 and for soft drinks in 1983. In 1996, it removed all restrictions, allowing use in all food products, including ones exposed to heat, which separates the main ingredients. The FDA has set an acceptable daily limit of 50 mg per kg of body weight, which assumes that aspartame can safely replace all sucrose sweeteners in the diet. The FDA approval, however, should not be equated with safety, particularly in light of how the product got the green light. In 1980 a three-member board of inquiry examined the test results of Searle, the pharmaceutical arm of Monsanto that manufactures aspartame. Although they thought",

General dentists may charge less, but may also be more likely to fracture or fail the attempted proceedure, which may result in tooth loss. Failure is possible, in any event, namely because a root canal is indicated when a vital tooth is quite sick, anyway. Crown costs are dependent on quality of the material (gold or porcelaine), the quality or fee charged by the lab the dentist chooses, and how much profit the dentist chooses to make off the proceedure. I have heard of fees as low as 400$ for stainless steel 'shells' in US rural areas (bad idea..), or prices as high as $2,000 per crown, if by high profile dentists in urban practices.

            "Definition Vitamins are a group of substances essential for normal metabolism, growth and development, and regulation of cell function. Vitamins work together with enzymes, co-factors (substances that assist enzymes), and other substances necessary for healthy life. Function Each vitamin has specific functions. If levels of a particular vitamin are inadequate, a deficiency disease results. Vitamin A helps in the formation and maintenance of healthy teeth, skeletal and soft tissue, mucous membranes, and skin. It is also known as retinol because it generates the pigments that are necessary for the working of the retina. It promotes good vision, especially in dim light. Vitamin A may also be required for reproduction and breast-feeding. Beta-carotene is a precursor to vitamin A that has antioxidant properties, helping the body deal with unstable chemicals called free radicals. Thiamine (B-1) helps the body cells convert carbohydrates into energy. It is also essential for the functioning of the heart and for healthy nerve cells, including those in the brain. Riboflavin (B-2) works with the other B vitamins and is important for body growth and red blood cell production. Similar to thiamine, it helps in releasing energy from carbohydrates. Niacin is a B vitamin that helps maintain healthy skin and nerves. It is also important for the conversion of food to energy and may have cholesterol-lowering effects. Vitamin B-6 is also known as pyridoxine. The more protein a person eats, the more vitamin B-6 is required to help the body use the protein. It aids in the formation of red blood cells and in the maintenance of normal brain function. It also assists in the synthesizing of antibodies in the immune system. Vitamin B-12, like the other B vitamins, is important for metabolism. It, too, helps in the formation of red blood cells and in the maintenance of the central nervous system. Pantothenic acid is essential for the metabolism of food. It is also essential in the synthesis of hormones and cholesterol. Biotin is essential for the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates, and in the synthesis of hormones and cholesterol. Cholesterol is needed for the functioning of cell membranes, particularly in the brain. Folate (folic acid) works with vitamin B-12 in the production of red blood cells. It is necessary for the synthesis of DNA, which controls heredity as well as tissue growth and cell function. Any woman who may become pregnant should be sure to consume enough folate -- low levels of this substance are associated with devastating birth defects such as spina bifida. Many foods are now fortified with folic acid to help reduce the level of such birth defects. Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, promotes healthy teeth and gums, helps in the absorption of iron, and helps maintain normal connective tissue. It also promotes wound healing and is an antioxidant. Vitamin D is also known as the \"sunshine vitamin,\" since it is manufactured by the body after being exposed to sunshine. Ten to 15 minutes of sunshine three times per week is adequate to produce the body's requirement of vitamin D. This vitamin promotes the body's absorption of calcium, which is essential for the normal development and maintenance of healthy teeth and bones. It also helps maintain adequate blood levels of calcium and phosphorus, which are minerals necessary for many functions. Vitamin E is also known as tocopherol and is an antioxidant. It is also important in the formation of red blood cells and the use of vitamin K. Vitamin K is known as the clotting vitamin, because without it blood would not coagulate. Some studies indicate that it helps in maintaining strong bones in the elderly.",

Each vitamin serves specific roles Vitamin A supports teeth, tissues, vision, breast-feeding and reproduction , with its precursor beta-carotene acting as an antioxidant. Vitamins B like Thiamine(B-1) for energy conversion, Riboflavin for red blood cell formation and growth, Niacin for healthy skin and nerves and energy conversion, B-6 for formation of red blood cells and in the maintenance of normal brain function B-12 for metabolism. Pantothenic Acid is essential for the metabolism of food, Biotin for metabolism. Folate, or Folic Acid, plays a key role in producing red blood cells, DNA synthesis, and preventing birth defects. Vitamin C promotes dental health, iron absorption, connective tissue maintenance, wound healing, and acts as an antioxidant. Vitamin D, obtained through sunlight exposure, aids in calcium absorption for bone and teeth health. Vitamin E, an antioxidant, is vital for red blood cell formation and the utilization of Vitamin K.

Pericarditis involves inflammation of the pericardium, the membrane surrounding the heart, which may be caused by fluid loss or infection and can be reversed. In contrast, cardiomyopathy, typically resulting from a heart attack or ischemia, is irreversible as it involves the death of heart cells.

The pressure-time graphs derived from this procedure can aid in differentiating these two types of pericarditis.

Do other animals laugh? Do the gods laugh? How do artists and performers make us laugh? Are there kinds of laughter? Has laughter changed across time? Across space? Is laughter gendered? Is there a specifically Roman, Japanese, or Southern laughter? Is there anything that can\u2019t or mustn\u2019t be funny? What is the opposite of laughter?

The physiological benefits of laughter are also highlighted, emphasizing its impact on pleasure and pain. An article from 1860 by Herbert Spencer delves into the physiology of laughter. Courses, such as USSO 214 - Laughter at Case Western Reserve University, investigate laughter from diverse perspectives, addressing questions about how and why we laugh, the physiological and psychological aspects, and the cultural and gendered dimensions of laughter.

Regular dairy products, such as whole milk, butter, cheese, cream cheese and ricotta cheese, are high in saturated fat. Limit the amount of saturated fat. No more than 5 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. That's about 10 to11 grams a day for most people. One tablespoon of butter has 7 grams of saturated fat; a tablespoon of margarine has only 2 grams of saturated fat. Avoid foods with added trans-fat. This fat comes from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils often found in fried foods and processed foods such as crackers, baked goods and desserts. Base most of your meals on beans, vegetables, fruits and whole grains, with a minimum of low saturated fat foods from animal protein such as nonfat dairy, fish and egg whites. Include soy protein in your diet in place of animal protein when possible. Studies show that 25 grams of soy protein per day can help lower cholesterol when part of a heart-healthy diet. Limit intake of sugar and fructose. Doing so should lower triglycerides, aid weight loss and lower LDL cholesterol levels. Eat foods naturally high in fiber, especially soluble fiber.

Problem here is to find an actual quality brand of cyan pepper, one that isn't synthetic but herbal in nature. The reason it is good for your stomach is that it removes toxins naturally from your stomach lining. It also stimulates the chemicals that make the lining more firm. The reason it is good for your heart and blood vessels is that it helps bind and remove cholesterol. Thus enabling the system to remove the 'chunky' fat, much easier. The reason it is good for your sinus is that it stimulates the sneeze/clear reflex. In general it is not good to breath cyan pepper in, but eating it and just sniffing it on food is good enough to make most peoples sinuses open up. Cyan pepper is also good as a compote (paste mixed with milk/water and baking soda/powder) to be used as a topical on non break skin wounds, and abbrasions.

Building muscle through exercise can elevate metabolism, allowing for a more lenient diet without easily gaining fat.

            "If yoyou mean Roseola it is the following What is roseola? Roseola (roseola infantum) is a mild illness caused by a virus. It is generally harmless and is most common in children 6 months to 2 years of age. It is rare after age 4. What causes roseola? Roseola is caused by two common viruses. The viruses belong to the family of herpes viruses, but they do not cause the cold sores or genital infections that herpes simplex viruses can cause. The viruses that cause roseola are spread through tiny droplets of fluid from the nose and throat of infected people when they laugh, talk, sneeze, or cough. It is thought that the viruses are spread by someone who has not yet developed the symptoms of roseola. There is no known way to prevent the spread of roseola. What are the symptoms of roseola? Roseola often starts with a sudden high fever [103\u00b0 (39.4\u00b0) to 105\u00b0 (40.6\u00b0)] that lasts 2 to 3 days, although it can last up to 8 days. The rapid increase in temperature may be the first sign of roseola and often occurs before yoyou realize that your child has a fever. The fever ends suddenly. After the fever ends, a rosy-pink rash may appear over your child's entire body, starting on the torso and spreading to the face, neck, and arms. The rash is not itchy and may last 1 to 2 days. The rash may appear without the fever. On rare occasions, a sore throat, stomach ache, vomiting, and diarrhea occur. A child with roseola may appear fussy or irritable and may have a decreased appetite, but most children behave almost normally. How is roseola diagnosed? Roseola is diagnosed through a medical history and physical exam. Your health professional often will recognize roseola by the presence of fever and the appearance of a rash. How is roseola treated? The roseola fever can be managed with acetaminophen (such as Tylenol or Panadol), ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin), or sponge baths. Do not give aspirin to anyone younger than 20 years of age because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. The roseola rash will go away without medical treatment."

Organic mercury compounds may evaporate slowly at room temperature and may enter your body easily if yoyou breathe in the vapors.

If it is an issue of simply not having time to see a doctor, I cannot stress to yoyou strongly enough that yoyou should make time to see one. While it may be a nuisance now to take an afternoon off from work to go see a doctor, it cannot possibly be worse than having to be off for several weeks later after your strep has gotten out of hand. As far as dealing with the discomfort from strep, yoyou can use regular home remedies for sore throat. A warm water gargle with salt and baking soda will help with the sore throat. A pain/fever reducer will help as well, especially if yoyou are running a low-grade temperature. Yoyou should also know that not all infections of the throat are actually caused by strep. One reason why it is important to go to a doctor is because they can screen for strep and make sure that is the actual problem. There are other conditions, such as yeast infections (thrush) that can look a lot like strep. Bottom line, if it were me, I'd bite the bullet and go see someone. Get it tested to make sure it actually is strep, and if it is, get it treated."

        "labelled_summary": "Taking Wild Mountain oregano oil straight is suggested for strep throat, as it has been shown to be as effective as prescription antibiotics. Oregano oil is potent, so it's recommended to chase it down with water. A specific brand, Vitality Works, is available at iherb.com for $14.00 per bottle, which is more affordable than the North American Herb and Spice brand. It's emphasized that strep throat should be treated with antibiotics, and home remedies may not be sufficient. Chronic strep infections can lead to severe complications like post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). If there are financial constraints, seeking help from local community clinics or health department programs on a sliding scale based on ability to pay is suggested. It's strongly advised to see a doctor to ensure accurate diagnosis and proper treatment. Home remedies for throat discomfort include warm water gargle with salt and baking soda and using pain/fever reducers. It's crucial to differentiate between strep and other conditions that mimic its symptoms, and seeking professional medical advice is recommended."

Someone told me once that if yoyou had the capability to step onto the mat then yoyou can do Aikido. And since yoyou adjust your practice to your own speed and abilities, I think it would be possible if yoyou find a good sensei who's understanding or your limits. Since Aikido is also about mental training as well as physical training you're sure to benefit from it even if you're not able to go at it as hard as younger students.

It doesn't have to be a life of torture and deprivation, though. Depending on how much structure yoyou need, a program like Weight Watchers may be beneficial. I tend to stay away from fruit juices because they are loaded with calories and they dump sugar in you. Eating the whole fruit is better for yoyou - yoyou get the nutrients plus fiber. Portion control is key. But, yoyou also shouldn't deprive yourself of everything yoyou like. For example, yoyou can allow yourself a small treat (for example, a tablespoon of chocolate syrup in milk) everyday, and a larger treat once a week without sabotaging your efforts. Very important: exercise. If yoyou haven't been exercising much, start small, like walking. But keep it up and increase your activity level steadily. A combination of weight training and aerobics really works. Yoyou don't have to invest in a gym membership. Go our for a walk, run, or bike ride.

        "question": "wht causes ovarian cysts in the body? Any prevention?",
        "answers": [
            "Ovarian cysts form for numerous reasons. The most common type is a follicular cyst, which results from the growth of a follicle. A follicle is the normal fluid-filled sac that contains an egg. Follicular cysts form when the follicle grows larger than normal during the menstrual cycle and does not open to release the egg. Usually, follicular cysts resolve on their own over the course of days to months. Cysts can contain blood (hemorrhagic or endometrioid cysts) from injury or leakage of tiny blood vessels into the egg sac. If a woman is in her 40's, or younger, and has regular menstrual periods, most ovarian masses are \"functioning ovarian cysts,\" which are not really abnormal. They are related to the process of ovulation that happens with the menstrual cycle. They usually disappear on their own during a future menstrual cycle. Therefore, especially in women in their 20's and 30's, these cysts are watched for a few menstrual cycles to verify that they disappear. Because oral contraceptives work in part by preventing ovulation, physicians will not really expect women who are taking oral contraceptives to have common \"functioning ovarian cysts.\" Thus, women who develop ovarian cysts while taking oral contraceptives may be advised against simple observation; rather, they may receive closer monitoring with pelvic ultrasound or, less commonly, surgical exploration of the ovary. Functional ovarian cysts cannot be prevented if yoyou are ovulating. Anything that makes ovulation less frequent reduces your chance of developing an ovarian cyst. Birth control pills, pregnancy, and breast-feeding in the first 6 months following birth prevent ovulation. Ovulation ceases when menopause is complete. Women who use high-dose birth control pills have a modestly decreased risk of developing functional ovarian cysts; low-dose birth control pills seem to have a less preventive effect.",
            "It depends on how big the cyst is and depends on the doctors. If yoyou have one, it normally is not a big deal. Many females deal with PCOS which is poly-cystic ovary syndrome. Which means when a female has this they have many different cysts that cover the ovaries. And this females live perfectly normal lives for the most part. Just go talk to an OB-GYN."

Oral contraceptives, by preventing ovulation, reduce the likelihood of these cysts, but if developed during contraceptive use, closer monitoring may be recommended. Functional ovarian cysts cannot be prevented if ovulation occurs, but factors like birth control, pregnancy, and breastfeeding can reduce ovulation frequency. The size of the cyst and individual circumstances determine the medical approach, and having a cyst is often not a major concern. Some women may experience polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by multiple cysts covering the ovaries, but many lead normal lives."

Psychiatry defines these traits as a \"mental illness\", and promotes it as a \"disease\" that requires \"treatment\". It is not a \"disease\", despite claims made in certain peoples answers here. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes \"schizo-affecive disorder\", \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, as a genetic, biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or \"chemical imbalance\". \"For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign.\" Fred A. Baughman Jr., MD (Neurologist, Pediatric Neurology), & Fellow at the American Academy of Neurology. \"Chemical imbalance\u2026it\u2019s a shorthand term really, it\u2019s probably drug industry derived\u2026 We don\u2019t have tests because to do it, you\u2019d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea.\" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005. Symptoms that psychiatry labels as \"schizo-affective disorder\" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people have overcome disorders such as \"bipolar\" and \"schizo affective disorder\" through effective megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including \"schizophrenia\". [1,2,3,4,5,6] Yoyou may also be interested to know that the work undertaken by pioneers such as Dr. Lars Martensson and the late Dr. Loren Mosher show that there is also another way - far safer and more effective than psychiatric restraint, drugs and electro-shocks. For over a decade Loren R Mosher, MD, held a central position in American psychiatric research. He was the first Chief of the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia at the National Institute of Mental Health, 1969-1980. He founded the Schizophrenia Bulletin and for ten years he was its Editor-in-Chief. He also led the Soteria Project, which demonstrated that effective rehabilitation is possible without harmful antipsychotic drugs. Soteria provided a safe and sane environment where schizophrenic patients could stay, medication-free, with a young, nonprofessional staff trained to listen to and understand them and provide companionship. The idea was that schizophrenia or related disorders can often be overcome with the help of meaningful relationships, rather than with drugs, and that such treatment would eventually lead to unquestionably healthier lives. The results were fantastic. Over just 6 weeks, patients recovered as quickly as those treated with medication in hospitals. [7,8] Bottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a \"faith\", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called \"research\" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.

            "In a nutshell... Yes. But here's more information. What is Creatine? Creatine is a nutrient naturally found in all our bodies. It is a combination of 3 amino acids; arginine, glycine and methionine. Creatine helps provide the energy our muscles need to move, particularly quick and explosive movements. Muscle contraction is initially fuelled by ATP (adenosine-triphosphate ). Is Creatine Safe? Yes, Creatine is a natural amino acid present in the body of humans and animals. The human body has 100-115 grams of creatine in the form of creatine phosphate. No negative side effects have been noted in the research with the recommended levels of supplementation. Are there any noted side effects? Creatine is so efficient at shuttling water into the intramuscular compartment, that an emergent side effect associated with it is that of muscle cramping. This most often occurs when too little fluid is consumed whilst supplementing with creatine. Muscle Cramping, strains and tears are all anecdotal evidence that are not supported by scientific fact. This supplement has over 100 peer reviewed published studies. It's well researched and the safety in the short term and long term is well known. Personally I wouldn't recommend this supplement to teenagers but that is my own opinion, not based on facts supporting any side effects in teenage use.",

            "Most women with Crohn's disease are able to deliver healthy, full-term babies; however, many people have questions about the impact Crohn's disease will have on a pregnancy. Women who have Crohn's disease may be concerned about whether or not they have the physical capacity to carry a pregnancy to term, while men with Crohn's disease may worry whether medication has affected the viability of their sperm. Will we be able to conceive a baby? Women with an active case of Crohn's disease may have difficulty conceiving. Men who use sulfasalazine, a commonly used drug to treat Crohn's disease, may become temporarily infertile because the sulfa compound can decrease sperm production. If a man is trying to father a child, he should ask his physician about 5-ASA medications which can treat Crohn's disease without risking fertility. Women with Crohn\u2019s disease who are planning to become pregnant should consult a doctor. How can Crohn's disease affect my pregnancy? While most women with Crohn's disease are able to carry a full-term pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby, it is important for yoyou to know that your disease may affect your pregnancy in the following ways: A cesarean section may be required for some women who have Crohn's disease with complications, including abscesses or fistulas of the rectum or vagina. If a woman is experiencing an active bout of Crohn's disease during pregnancy she has a 2 to 3 times increased risk of miscarriage, delivering the baby prematurely, or stillbirth. If a woman has active Crohn's disease at the time of conception, the disease usually runs its course in a similar way to the pattern that was experienced before pregnancy. If a woman is experiencing active Crohn's disease prior to a pregnancy, she may notice that the symptoms of her disease worsen right after becoming pregnant and during the first 3 months of the pregnancy. The disease may also intensify right after the delivery of her baby. It's important to remember that every pregnancy is different. There is no evidence showing that if yoyou experience severe symptoms during your pregnancy, subsequent pregnancies will also be difficult. Should I change my diet now that I am pregnant? It is important for all pregnant women to eat a healthy and well-balanced diet. As a woman with Crohn's disease, in addition to eating a standard diet recommended during pregnancy, your obstetrician and gastroenterologist may also recommend some special foods, vitamins, and minerals. If your Crohn's disease is being treated with sulfasalazine, it is important that your diet be supplemented with folic acid, since this is an essential nutrient in preventing certain birth defects. Are medications for Crohn's disease safe to take during my pregnancy? All women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should avoid taking any unnecessary medications. However, if yoyou are experiencing active Crohn's disease, it may be necessary for yoyou to be treated with medication. If you\u2019re a pregnant woman and considering drug therapy, yoyou should speak with both your gastroenterologist and your obstetrician, so that each healthcare provider is well informed about current health issues when recommending treatment options. Are any diagnostic tests safe during pregnancy? All pregnant women should avoid having X-rays, especially during the first 12 weeks, unless it is absolutely necessary. Presently, MRIs are sometimes used, but more information is needed. The following tests may also be used for pregnant women who may have Crohn's disease for the management of their disease: Abdominal ultrasound Sigmoidoscopy Rectal biopsy Upper endoscopy Colonoscopy Will previous surgery for Crohn's disease affect my pregnancy? There is no evidence that a bowel resection due to Crohn's disease affects a woman's pregnancy. The opposite actually"

Women planning to become pregnant should consult a doctor. While most Crohn's-afflicted women can carry a full-term pregnancy, complications may necessitate a cesarean section. Active Crohn's disease during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, premature delivery, or stillbirth. Symptoms may intensify after conception or during the first trimester. Dietary considerations, such as supplementing with folic acid, are advised, especially for those on sulfasalazine. Medication safety during pregnancy requires careful evaluation, and pregnant women with Crohn's should consult both gastroenterologists and obstetricians. Diagnostic tests like X-rays are generally avoided during pregnancy, with alternatives such as abdominal ultrasound, sigmoidoscopy, rectal biopsy, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy considered. Prior bowel resection for Crohn's disease is not known to affect pregnancy negatively; in fact, evidence suggests the opposite.

Eats more food after dinner than during that meal. Eats more than half of daily food intake during and after dinner but before breakfast. May wake up and leave the bed to snack at night. May not be aware at the time of what they are doing. This pattern has persisted for at least two months. Person feels tense, anxious, upset, or guilty while eating. NES is thought to be stress related and is often accompanied by depression. Especially at night the person may be moody, tense, anxious, nervous, agitated, etc. Has trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Wakes frequently and then often eats. Foods ingested are often carbohydrates: sugary and starchy. Behavior is not like binge eating which is done in relatively short episodes. Night-eating syndrome involves continual eating throughout evening hours. This eating produces guilt and shame, not enjoyment. How many people have night-eating syndrome? Perhaps only one to two percent (1-2%) of adults in the general population have this problem, but research at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine suggests that about six percent of people who seek treatment for obesity have NES. Another study suggests that more than a quarter (27%) of people who are overweight by at least 100 pounds have the problem.",

Standard treatment for fungal nail infection includes one or a combination of the following: Antifungal pills (oral medication) offer the best chance of a cure. However, they require close monitoring for dangerous side effects and are generally reserved for moderate-to-severe or difficult-to-treat fungal nail infections. Pills include terbinafine (Lamisil), itraconazole (Sporanox), and fluconazole (Diflucan). Antifungal topical medication (creams, lotions, gels, and lacquers) are applied to the infected nail and surrounding areas of the skin. However, they are not very effective. They are sometimes used for mild-to-moderate infections and may be used to help prevent an infection from returning or to prevent athlete's foot from spreading to the nails. Topical medications include terbinafine (Lamisil) and ciclopirox (Penlac). Removal of an infected nail is used for severe or recurring fungal nail infections. Combining nail removal with antifungal creams or pills is likely to be more effective than using one of these treatments alone. Nail removal is rarely necessary. In nonsurgical nail removal, a urea ointment is put on the nail, softening and dissolving it for easy removal.

        "answers": [
            "What are false positive and false negative results? The Pap test is a screening test and, like any such test, it is not 100-percent accurate. Although false positive and false negative results do not occur very often, they can cause anxiety and can affect a woman\u2019s health. A false positive Pap test means that a patient is told she has abnormal cells, but the cells are actually normal. A false negative Pap test occurs when a specimen is called normal, but the woman has a significant abnormality that was missed. A false negative Pap test may delay the diagnosis and treatment of a precancerous condition. However, regular screening helps to compensate for the false negative result. If abnormal cells are missed at one time, chances are good that the cells will be detected the next time. What methods are being developed to improve the accuracy of Pap tests? In April 1996, the Consensus Development Conference on Cervical Cancer, which was convened by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), concluded that about half of false negative Pap tests are due to inadequate specimen collection. The other half are due to a failure to identify or interpret the specimens correctly. Although the conventional Pap test is effective in the majority of cases, the conference made it clear that new methods of collecting and reading specimens are needed to reduce the number of false negatives. The Bethesda System requires laboratories to determine whether there are enough cervical cells in the specimen to make a proper evaluation. This requirement helps improve the quality of samples and sample collection. The Bethesda System requires a sample to be categorized as \u201csatisfactory for evaluation\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory for evaluation.\u201d One new method of collecting and analyzing samples is called liquid-based thin-layer slide preparation. This method may make it easier to screen for abnormal cells. Cervical cells are collected with a brush or other collection instrument. The instrument is rinsed in a vial of liquid preservative. The vial is sent to a laboratory, where an automated thin-layer slide device prepares the slide for viewing. Results of this method suggest that it is comparable to, or more sensitive than, standard Pap tests for the detection of significant abnormalities. Computer automated readers are also being used to improve the reading of Pap tests. This technology uses a microscope that conveys a cellular image to a computer, which analyzes the image for the presence of abnormal cells.",

To enhance accuracy, the Bethesda System categorizes samples as \"satisfactory for evaluation\" or \"unsatisfactory for evaluation,\" promoting better specimen quality. New techniques like liquid-based thin-layer slide preparation and computer automated readers are emerging, offering potential improvements in detection sensitivity and interpretation accuracy. Regular screening helps compensate for these imperfections, increasing the likelihood of detecting abnormalities over time."

        "answers": [
            "Sickle Cell Anemia is a common autosomal recessive disorder resulting from the production of a variant hemoglobin called HbS (sickle cell hemoglobin). It is typically caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene at residue 6, Glyou \u2192Val (GAG\u2192 GTG) causing a loss of a negative charge and a decreased solubility of the mutant Hb (HbS). Under low oxygen tension, HbS aggregate (polymerizes in rod shaped form), distorting the shape of the RBC to sickle shape. This misshapen RBC is unable to squeeze through capillaries causing vascular occlusion and consequently local hypoxia or hemolysis. Because sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive condition, in order for a child to get it, they can inherit it from either one or both of their parents, and in the former case, they will be a carrier and will exhibit sickle cell trait (e.g., only some blood cells are sickled). In the latter case, all their RBCs will be sickled. In places such as Africa where Malaria (plasmodium falciparum) is quite prevalent, sickle cell trait provides a selective advantage for carriers. Some common symptoms are: Anemia (Hb level 6-10 g/dL) Failure to thrive Splenomegaly Repeated infection Painful swelling of hands or feet (from occlusion of capillaries) Infection major cause of death",
            "Sickle cell anemia is an inability of red blood cells to properly carry oxygen due to a change in the genetic code. It is notable because the affected cells fold over to form thin, curved RBCs resembling sickles (the farm tools). Also notable is that the disease is genetic and caused by a single change in the DNA. It is far more prevalent in African-Americans. Symptoms are similar to any anemia: general malaise (lack of energy).",

In regions with prevalent malaria, carrying the sickle cell trait offers selective advantages. Common symptoms include anemia (Hb level 6-10), generalized malaise, and unique sickle-shaped RBCs. More prevalent among African-Americans, this condition impedes RBCs' oxygen-carrying capacity due to a genetic alteration, forming sickle-like RBCs that resemble farm tools"

        "question": "what is stress?",
        "answers": [
            "an unpleasant state of emotional and physiological arousal that people experience in situations that they perceive as dangerous or threatening to their well-being. The word stress means different things to different people. Some people define stress as events or situations that cause them to feel tension, pressure, or negative emotions such as anxiety and anger. Others view stress as the response to these situations. This response includes physiological changes\u2014such as increased heart rate and muscle tension\u2014as well as emotional and behavioral changes. However, most psychologists regard stress as a process involving a person\u2019s interpretation and response to a threatening event. Stress is a common experience. We may feel stress when we are very busy, have important deadlines to meet, or have too little time to finish all of our tasks. Often people experience stress because of problems at work or in social relationships, such as a poor evaluation by a supervisor or an argument with a friend. Some people may be particularly vulnerable to stress in situations involving the threat of failure or personal humiliation. Others have extreme fears of objects or things associated with physical threats\u2014such as snakes, illness, storms, or flying in an airplane\u2014and become stressed when they encounter or think about these perceived threats. Major life events, such as the death of a loved one, can cause severe stress. Stress can have both positive and negative effects. Stress is a normal, adaptive reaction to threat. It signals danger and prepares us to take defensive action. Fear of things that pose realistic threats motivates us to deal with them or avoid them. Stress also motivates us to achieve and fuels creativity. Although stress may hinder performance on difficult tasks, moderate stress seems to improve motivation and performance on less complex tasks. In personal relationships, stress often leads to less cooperation and more aggression. If not managed appropriately, stress can lead to serious problems. Exposure to chronic stress can contribute to both physical illnesses, such as heart disease, and mental illnesses, such as anxiety disorders. The field of health psychology focuses in part on how stress affects bodily functioning and on how people can use stress management techniques to prevent or minimize disease.",

It can stem from various sources, such as busy schedules, looming deadlines, work-related pressures, or interpersonal conflicts. The interpretation of stress varies among individuals, encompassing feelings of tension and negative emotions. While stress can serve as a normal and adaptive response, signaling danger and motivating defensive actions, chronic exposure may lead to adverse effects on both physical and mental health. Effective stress management techniques play a crucial role in mitigating these impacts, emphasizing the importance of understanding and addressing stressors for overall well-being."

        "question": "why is it i breathe through my nose only when sleeping?",
        "answers": [
            "Well, breathing only through your nose is the typical way of breathing, so I'm not sure what about breathing only through your nose is a problem for you. Breathing being involutary, most people do not pay attention to how they breathe. Paying attention to how yoyou breathe probably does have the effect of making yoyou more anxious and it would seem to keep yoyou from going to sleep as quickly as yoyou would if yoyou weren't always monitoring your breathing. Monitoring your breathing keeps yoyou alert rather than helping yoyou relax and fall asleep. My notion: yoyou are too focused on how yoyou breath. As long as yoyou don't have mechanical difficulties breathing then it doesn't matter how yoyou breathe. Work on not paying attention to this....",
            "When yoyou breathe through only nose, more heat accumulates in your body. Breatheing through mouth dissapates heat. And there are more benefits of doing so. Its considered bad to breathe through mouth for some reasons. http://www.breathing.com/articles/nose-breathing.htm So there is nothing to worry about for your problem. Yoyou are perfectly alright. One more thing is that, even though we all are alike, but our overall ability of matabolism is a balance of this breathing and our other muscular factors and ofcourse number of times our hearts beat. For example, the Neanderthals used to have bigger and more open nose, so as to breathe rapidly and conserve heat. So yoyou are what yoyou are made of and don't try to fight it, unless its uncomfortable for you."
        ],
        "labelled_summary": "Breathing exclusively through the nose is the typical and natural way of breathing. Most people don't consciously pay attention to their breathing due to its involuntary nature. However, focusing on how yoyou breathe can potentially increase anxiety and hinder the ability to fall asleep quickly. Nose breathing accumulates more heat in the body, while breathing through the mouth dissipates heat. There are various benefits associated with nose breathing, as outlined in a provided source. While individual variations exist, overall metabolism is influenced by factors such as breathing, muscular activity, and heart rate. The example of Neanderthals having larger, more open noses illustrates how breathing patterns can adapt to specific needs, such as rapid breathing for heat conservation. In summary, breathing through the nose is generally considered normal, and there is no need for concern about potential issues."

As a counselor a few that I have seen have the least side effects are Lexapro, Zoloft, Paxil and WelButrin. I would highly recommend counseling or therapy before starting any of the brain drugs, most want the quick fix, which comes with medication but yoyou will find that 6 months down the road the medication will quit working, so it will be increased, changed, or yoyou will be told yoyou have other problems for which a new medication is added, next thing yoyou know yoyou are taking all these drugs and feeling worse. So I wouldn't take any of them, but if yoyou feel yoyou must do some research on whatever it is your prescribed, so at least yoyou know what long term side effects there are, but in most cases there will be no evidence of what these are because the drugs are so new. Just take a trip down to a local mental health agency and take a look at some of the people were put on the wonderfull antidepressants and other brain drugs that were so miraculous for there time that now the people who took them don't have a clue where they are.

Maybe the problem can be handle by yoyou confronting and solving the problem. THERE ARE NO MAGIC PILLS! Don't expect the anti-depressant drug to be the solution. A lot of people who came of anti-depressant went suicidal especially teens. Try an alternative such as getting to know yourself better, meditate, exercise, eat healthy, get spiritual and/or pay attention to your emotion day to day. It really helps.

Limited to one per day, aspirin is known to slightly thin the blood, potentially reducing inflammation and lowering the risk of strokes. Some studies suggest that a daily aspirin regimen can ease the workload on the heart by thinning the blood. However, it's important to note that, akin to conflicting studies on dietary habits like consuming eggs for health, there may be divergent perspectives on the overall benefits of aspirin. Individual considerations and medical advice should be taken into account before incorporating aspirin into one's daily routine."

I have also tried biofeedback, steroid shots, trigger point injections, nerve blocks, accupuncture, foot braces, wrist braces, carpal tunnel release surguries, and so much more. All just torture and I felt like a guinea pig. My best advise is make sure to get plenty of sleep, take a multiple vitamin, keep active in at least low impact sports, and consider Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements (consult the doctor or a nutritionist to have your Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful), meditation does help some in keeping the pain back if yoyou can seperate your mind from the pain, and try to take 2-3 warm Epson Salt baths a week (Epson salt contains Magnesium and soaking in a warm tub of it helps to get the mineral into the body. Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps, spasms, and pain.) Also, Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro. Try eliminating Monsodium Glutamate from your diet. I did and some of my symptoms (chronic headaches and nausea) went away. It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup.

        "answers": [
            "Only with adult onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. If yoyou got it when yoyou were a kid, forget about it, you'll need medicine for the rest of your life. But if yoyou developed it at an older age, it is most likey type 2, and can be controlled with strict diet and exercise. Not definite, but it is always worth a try. Here is a good diet I would suggest: First of all, (very important) don't eat ANY type of meat . This includes any soups that have a beef/chicken stock as the base. So buy vegetarian vegetable soup...not just vegetable soup, and eat it for supper(Campbell's (don't buy generic brand..its bland). This also includes milk. No cow milk. Buy some Soy milk. I promise it is delicious..I use 8th continent original soymilk. And this is 100% healthier than cow milk. This will help yoyou alot. (no butter for a week!, no ranch dressing, no sour cream...nothing of the sort...and try to lay off of the cheese unless it is soy cheese) Second of all, no candy bars, chocolates, donuts with frosting center, cakes, ice cream....just go 1 week without sweets I usually eat oatmeal for breakfast, and I either cut up fresh peaches, strawberries or even canned peaches and I don't need any sugar. For a good snack in between I drink a mug of hot lemon water with honey added to sweeten. (*when feeling hungry, drinking a mug/cup of anything warm will ease your hungry tummy*) For snacks when craving sweets: eat almonds, peanuts, soynuts, raisins, ovaltine mixed with soymilk is ok on this detox diet, drink a big cup of orange juice, eat fresh fruit, apples, oranges, strawberries, etc. Eat vegetables and rice. Can buy frozen packages of broccolli, cauliflower, carrots, and raw type as well for snacks. Got a blender? Make smoothies with your new fruit selections, a natural, detoxing milkshake. Just don't use yogurt(which is cow milk based), >>>but add some soymilk, orange juice, bananas and strawberries for a shake that is out of this world! I have always used this as my way to start exercising again. (tip: Slim Fast products have always helped me too(even though the shakes are cow-milk based). They have a meal bar called \"fruit & nut bar\" that is great. If i wake up and want to go for a jog or exercise, I take about 2-3 bites (don't eat whole bar before exercising) and it helps me feel not-sluggish during my workout.) Major tip: anyone over the age of 20 should be taking a daily vitamin. I HIGHLY suggest buying some multivitamins (i use a woman's weight smart MV), Super B-Complex, and Vitamin C. These 3 are a must-take-each-day and you'll see an even better change in a couple of weeks. If I am feeling bloated, I buy diurex water pills and take for 5-7 days as well. Follow this strictly and yoyou WILL see a change & feel better, that is a promise! (warning: if yoyou have any cardiovascular problems at all do Not use water pills unless it is ok'd by your doctor, as it will interfere with your High BP medicine; and as always, if yoyou are on any medications discuss any dramatic new diet choices with your doctor as it could affect the purpose of your medicine.)",

        "question": "Does anyone know about bacterial vaginitis?",
        "answers": [
            "I think yoyou meant bacterial vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis causes specific symptoms that are different from two other common types of vaginal infections, vaginal yeast infection and trichomoniasis. It is possible to have more than one type of vaginal infection at the same time. For more information on the other types, see the topics Vaginal Yeast Infections and Trichomoniasis. What is bacterial vaginosis? Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a change in the balance of bacteria that are normally present in the vagina, which can cause bothersome symptoms. BV is the most common cause of vaginal symptoms in women of childbearing age. What are the symptoms? The most notable symptom of bacterial vaginosis is an excessive, bad-smelling, grayish-white vaginal discharge. A \"fishy\" smell, which is usually worse after sex, is a telltale sign of BV. However, about half of women with BV have no noticeable symptoms. 1 What risks are related to bacterial vaginosis? BV is of particular concern when yoyou are pregnant. During pregnancy, BV is linked to complications, such as miscarriage, early (preterm) delivery, and pelvic infection after childbirth. 2 Uterine infection is a common trigger of preterm labor\u2014BV could lead to this type of infection or could be a red flag for another problem causing preterm labor. Experts continue to research whether BV is a direct or indirect cause. Having BV at the time of an invasive pelvic procedure (such as a cesarean delivery, hysterectomy, clinical abortion, endometrial biopsy, or intrauterine device (IUD) placement) increases your risk of developing a pelvic infection. Having BV at the time of exposure to a sexually transmitted disease (including HIV) increases your risk of becoming infected. 3 What causes bacterial vaginosis? The cause of BV is poorly understood. However, a number of known risk factors can lead to a drop in \"good\" lactobacillus bacteria in the vagina and an increase in less friendly bacteria, whose growth is usually kept in check by higher levels of lactobacillus. These risk factors include sexual activity, history of sexually transmitted disease, douching, and tampon, diaphragm, and IUD use. BV is more common among women who have multiple sex partners or female sex partners. BV is sometimes linked to hormonal changes; it is more common around the time of menstruation and is found in up to 23% of pregnant women. 4 How is bacterial vaginosis diagnosed? Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed based on your symptoms, a pelvic examination, and a microscope inspection of a sample of vaginal discharge. When low numbers of lactobacillus organisms and higher numbers of other bacteria are present under the microscope, BV is diagnosed. How is it treated? BV goes away without treatment about 25% of the time, so treatment isn't always necessary. 3 Yoyou will likely be screened and treated for BV if you: Are planning an invasive pelvic procedure that could result in an infection. Have BV symptoms, especially while pregnant. Are pregnant and have a history of preterm delivery that may have been caused by infection. Have symptoms that aren't going away on their own. BV is typically treated with antibiotic medication. Metronidazole (Flagyl) is the first-choice treatment for BV. If yoyou aren't pregnant, yoyou can choose to take it by mouth (orally) or by inserting it into the vagina; pregnant women are only treated orally. Antibiotic treatment for BV can lead to vaginal yeast infections because the medications change the balance of organisms in the vagina, allowing an excess of yeast to grow. Yoyou may be able to prevent this by regularly eating yogurt with active Lactobacillus acidophilus culture or taking L. acidophilus dietary supplements. Some women have success with using oral or vaginal lactobacillus by itself to treat bacterial vaginosis. 5 Because BV is not caused by sexually transmitted organisms, treating your",

The cause tends to be a change in pH levels due to hormone fluctuations, stress, yeast infection treatments, etc. The gel isn't nearly as bad as the oral antibiotics. There's a white discharge and there can be some burning. Many times after yoyou finish with the gel yoyou end up with a yeast infection.

        "answers": [
            "MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a fairly new technique that has been used since the beginning of the 1980s. The MRI scan uses magnetic and radio waves, meaning that there is no exposure to X-rays or any other damaging forms of radiation. How does an MRI scanner work? The patient lies inside a large, cylinder-shaped magnet. Radio waves 10,000 to 30,000 times stronger than the magnetic field of the earth are then sent through the body. This affects the body's atoms, forcing the nuclei into a different position. As they move back into place they send out radio waves of their own. The scanner picks up these signals and a computer turns them into a picture. These pictures are based on the location and strength of the incoming signals. Our body consists mainly of water, and water contains hydrogen atoms. For this reason, the nucleus of the hydrogen atom is often used to create an MRI scan in the manner described above. What does an MRI scan show? Using an MRI scanner, it is possible to make pictures of almost all the tissue in the body. The tissue that has the least hydrogen atoms (such as bones) turns out dark, while the tissue that has many hydrogen atoms (such as fatty tissue) looks much brighter. By changing the timing of the radiowave pulses it is possible to gain information about the different types of tissues that are present. An MRI scan is also able to provide clear pictures of parts of the body that are surrounded by bone tissue, so the technique is useful when examining the brain and spinal cord. Because the MRI scan gives very detailed pictures it is the best technique when it comes to finding tumours (benign or malignant abnormal growths) in the brain. If a tumour is present the scan can also be used to find out if it has spread into nearby brain tissue. The technique also allows us to focus on other details in the brain. For example, it makes it possible to see the strands of abnormal tissue that occur if someone has multiple sclerosis and it is possible to see changes occurring when there is bleeding in the brain, or find out if the brain tissue has suffered lack of oxygen after a stroke. The MRI scan is also able to show both the heart and the large blood vessels in the surrounding tissue. This makes it possible to detect heart defects that have been building up since birth, as well as changes in the thickness of the muscles around the heart following a heart attack. The method can also be used to examine the joints, spine and sometimes the soft parts of your body such as the liver, kidneys and spleen. How does an MRI scan differ from a CT scan? With an MRI scan it is possible to take pictures from almost every angle, whereas a CT scan only shows pictures horizontally. There is no ionizing radiation (X-rays) involved in producing an MRI scan. MRI scans are generally more detailed, too. The difference between normal and abnormal tissue is often clearer on the MRI scan than on the CT scan. How is an MRI scan performed? The scan is usually done as an outpatient procedure, which means that the patient can go home after the test. During the scan it is important to lie completely still. For this reason it might be necessary to give a child an anaesthetic before they are tested. Since yoyou are exposed to a powerful magnetic field during the MRI scan, it is important not to wear jewellery or any other metal objects. It is also important for the patient to inform medical staff if they use electrical appliances, such as a hearing aid or pacemaker, or have any metal in their body such as surgical clips, but orthopaedic metalware such as artificial hips or bone screws is not normally a problem. Is an MRI scan dangerous? There are no known dangers or side effects connected to an MRI scan. The test is not painful; yoyou cannot feel it. Since radiation is not used, the procedure can be repeated without problems. There is a small theoretical risk to the foet",

It is especially valuable for detecting tumors, abnormalities, and changes in tissues due to conditions like multiple sclerosis, bleeding in the brain, or strokes.Contrasted with CT scans, MRI scans offer images from various angles without ionizing radiation, and the detailed nature of MRI often provides clearer distinctions between normal and abnormal tissues.

Strep throat will go away in 3 to 7 days with or without treatment. However, strep throat is still treated with antibiotics even if they do not speed recovery.

            "Hello! I am a lisenced cosmetologist/esthitician and I work for a health spa's internet company selling Dermalogica skin care products. I understand your woes from personal experience, I never got acne problems untill I reached my 20's and then I had acne breakouts contsantly (and still deal with them). First thing to remember is that popping them will always be worse, the infected liquid (puss) inside will more than likely spread onto uninfected skin causing more breakouts. Also, popping them by force will cause a small rupture in your skin leading to scarring. The best thing to do is leave it be, but be sure yoyou cleanse your face twice daily and if yoyou haven't already, try and get into a good daily regimen which should include (but not limited to) using a cleanser suited for your skin type, followed by applying a toner and then immediately applying a moisturizer. Finally, yoyou can use a clearing and scar diminishing blemish control product that can help. Another thing to keep in mind is that even if your skin is oily, yoyou should never dry it out. Oily skin still needs to be moisturized, drying it out removes the skin's natural barrier and can provoke more breakouts. I can suggest some of Dermalogica's product since I am very familiar with it and trust the quality. Dermalogica makes a medicated clearing gel that I use, a special clearing booster and an acne prone skin care kit. I will provide yoyou with my employer's website because we sell at discount rates and Dermalogica tends to be pricey. It is not the only brand out there of course, so look around and find a skin care line that works for yoyou (there are also two other lines on the site).

Ignoring gum care may result in conditions like gingivitis and swollen gums, indicating a potential infection caused by food particles lodged between teeth."

Yoyou burn calories with activity. Yoyou want to go in the hole--in the red. Yoyou want to burn more than yoyou eat. It is dangerous to eat less than 1200 calories a day. If yoyou pick the right foods, yoyou can fill up on about 1600 calories a day, then do an exercise yoyou enjoy for about 45 minutes a day. The exercise needs to be aerobic (make your heart go fast) for an extended period of time. Then, yoyou will be healthy regardless of what your weight does, and yoyou will probably shed some unwanted pounds. Just be careful about diets.",

Carbohydrates are deemed essential in the diet, likened to a caloric bank where intake and expenditure should be balanced for overall health. Maintaining a caloric deficit, burning more calories than consumed, is a key principle for weight management. Consuming fewer than 1200 calories a day is considered perilous. While various low-carb diets exist, caution is advised due to potential health risks associated with severely restricting carbohydrate intake."

The male hormone androgen is present in both male and female bodies, especially during puberty. Androgen can enlarge the sebaceous glands in hair follicles, leading to greater amounts of oily sebum being produced. Heredity is also one of the causes of acne. If a parent had acne as a teenager, chances are good his/her child will too. And the more severe the parents' condition, the greater the likelihood that the children's acne will also be severe. Stress and Acne Whether stress plays a role in acne or not is an issue of considerable debate. Severe emotional stress has been linked to acne, although the relationship is not clear. Some doctors blame anti-stress and depression medications for acne in these cases, rather than stress itself.",

Acne is primarily influenced by factors like genetics and hormonal changes. If your parents had severe acne, there's a higher chance yoyou might too. Stress, which can be linked to acne, is another factor. Coffee can stimulate the production of stress-related hormones like cortisol, which may worsen acne.

I had a sort of personal epiphany about 3 months ago, and I came to the realization that we, especially as Americans, put a lot of stuff into our mouths that isn't healthy. And I'm not just talking about fat and sugar; I'm also talking about artificial sweeteners and fake fat etc. The decision I came to was that no food or drink, no matter how sumptuous, was worth the extra weight that could come with it. Nothing. I stopped eating anything that wasn't good for me. When I feel like something sweet, I put frozen strawberries in a blender, then add non-fat milk and blend until very smooth. If it's not quite sweet enough, add just a tiny bit of sugar or honey. Yoyou can also add yogurt, bananas, blueberries, raspberries, and I'm sure a host of other fruit.

        "answers": [
            "The key to relieving the symptoms is to reduce sinus swelling and inflammation and facilitate mucous drainage from the sinuses. There are several at-home steps that help prevent sinus headache or alleviate its pain. They include: Breathe moist air: Relief for a sinus headache can be achieved by humidifying the dry air environment. This can be done by using a steam vaporizer or cool-mist humidifier, steam from a basin of hot water, or steam from a hot shower. Alternate hot and cold compresses: Place a hot compress across your sinuses for three minutes, and then a cold compress for 30 seconds. Repeat this procedure three times per treatment, two to six times a day. Nasal irrigation: Some believe that when nasal irrigation or rinse is performed, mucus, allergy creating particles and irritants such as pollens, dust particles, pollutants and bacteria are washed away, reducing the inflammation of the mucous membrane. Normal mucosa will fight infections and allergies better and will reduce the symptoms. Nasal irrigation helps shrink the sinus membranes and thus increases drainage. There are several over-the-counter nasal rinse products available. Consult your ear, nose, and throat specialist for directions on making a home nasal rinse or irrigation solution. Over-the-counter medications: Some over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are highly effective in reducing sinus headache pain. The primary ingredient in most OTC pain relievers is aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, or a combination of them. The best way to choose a pain reliever is by determining which of these ingredients works best for you. Decongestants: Sinus pressure headaches caused by allergies are usually treated with decongestants and antihistamines. In difficult cases, nasal steroid sprays may be recommended. Alternative medicine: Chinese herbalists use Magnolia Flower as a remedy for clogged sinus and nasal passages. In conjunction with other herbs, such as angelica, mint, and chrysanthemum, it is often recommended for upper respiratory tract infections and sinus headaches, although its effectiveness for these problems has not been scientifically confirmed.",

            "Pata\u00f1jali divides the practice of yoga into eight stages. Yama, or restraint from vice, and niyama, or observance of purity and virtue, lay the moral foundation for practice and remove the disturbance of uncontrolled desires. Asana, or posture, and pranayama, or breath control, calm the physical body, while pratyahara, or withdrawal of the senses, detaches the mind from the external world. Internal control of consciousness is accomplished in the final three stages: dharana, or concentration, dhyana, or meditation, and samadhi. Through such practices yogis acquire miraculous powers, which must ultimately be renounced to attain the highest state. In samadhi the subject-object distinction and one's sense of an individual self disappear in a state usually described as one of supreme peace, bliss, and illumination. A common feature of different traditions of yoga is one-pointed concentration on a chosen object, whether a part of the body, the breath, a mantra, a diagram, a deity, or an idea.",

However, motivation can be a significant challenge for depressed individuals. Starting slowly and choosing enjoyable exercises, preferably with a supportive partner or group, can help overcome this hurdle. Yoga, as outlined by Pata\u00f1jali, involves eight stages, beginning with moral foundations (Yama and Niyama), followed by physical postures (Asana) and breath control (Pranayama). Pratyahara involves withdrawing the senses, leading to internal control through concentration (Dharana), meditation (Dhyana), and ultimately, samadhi, where the distinction between self and the external world dissolves. Different traditions of yoga emphasize one-pointed concentration on various objects or ideas. The goal is to attain a state of supreme peace, bliss, and illumination, often characterized by the disappearance of individual self-awareness."

            "Try this website. I have depression, so I tried this website. Good luck",
            "I understand your desire to learn about depression and remedies for it. I have three things that have gotten me through times when I've been depressed, and they're all gentle solutions that I think will suit an intelligent person like yourself. 1 - The first is what Freud calls the \"talking cure\". He insists that it must be performed by a psychoanalyst who yoyou are paying for, but actually I've performed it by writing in a diary. The key is to be very honest, and try to find connections that yoyou might otherwise be supressing, because these are the areas that need work. For example, what's the first thing that pops into your mind when yoyou think of \"depression\"? If the answer is \"flying a kite\", then follow the chain... What do yoyou think of when yoyou think of \"kite\" and \"flying\"... You'll be surprised how quickly this takes yoyou right down to an event in your childhood or an unresolved conflict that might have happened a year ago. 2 - Looking for lies. A chair cannot make yoyou depressed. A lampshade cannot make yoyou depressed. Only another person can make yoyou depressed. I believe it is because a chair and a lampshade cannot lie. Only a person can lie. Depression, it seems to me, comes from believing a lie. That conflict (between reality and the lie) takes up so much mental energy to maintain, it drains yoyou as a whole. Yoyou may find, after using technique #1, that it leads to yoyou to this conclusion #2. For example, after free associating your way to an event, yoyou might find that it was when someone told yoyou that yoyou weren't worth a hill of beans. The problem is not that they insulted you, the problem is that yoyou believed the lie. Beware, giving up on a lie that we've believed in for a long time is tougher than it sounds. 3 - This one is going to sound goofy, especially after wading in deeply with the other two techniques. Get some light to shine on the cells in the back of your eyes. Go outside for an extended period of time without sunglasses (no need to stare at the sun or a light-bulb, indirect light will do). Use one of those gentle light therapy products like www.everlyte.com . Take a trip on a sailboat. Spend a few hours in open fields on sunny days. It's those cells in the eyes that produce much of the chemical that pills and herbal remedies seek to replace, but the cells in the eyes put the chemicals where they are needed, in your brain, and not in your stomach and everywhere else. This third technique will help yoyou with the other two, allowing yoyou to think clearly, and get out from being stuck in a loop. I hope this \"whole-istic\" answer is as helpful to yoyou as it has been to me over the years. A gentle look at the whole picture is often better than a sledgehammer to just one piece of the problem."

The first involves a form of the \"talking cure,\" inspired by Freud, where honesty is paramount, and connections in thoughts are identified, even through diary reflections.

The third technique recommends light therapy, exposing the eyes to natural light to stimulate the cells responsible for producing essential brain chemicals.

A: Your water supplier must notify yoyou by newspaper, mail, radio, TV, or hand-delivery if your water doesn't meet EPA or state standards or if there is a waterborne disease emergency. The notice will describe any precautions yoyou need to take, such as boiling your water. Follow the advice of your water supplier if yoyou ever receive such a notice. The most common drinking water emergency is contamination by disease-causing germs. Boiling your water for one minute will kill these germs. Yoyou can also use common household bleach or iodine to disinfect your drinking water at home in an emergency, such as a flood (see EPA's emergency disinfection fact sheet for specific directions on how to disinfect your drinking water in an emergency).",

        ],
        "labelled_summary": "To determine if tap water is safe to drink, it's essential to check with the local health department or the water supplier, particularly if you're on city water. The taste and quality of drinking water can vary due to different sources and treatment processes. Over 90 percent of water systems meet EPA standards for tap water quality. Water suppliers serving the same people year-round are required to provide an annual water quality report to customers. This report, often called a consumer confidence report, details the quality of the drinking water. Contact your water supplier for a copy or check if the report is available online.If yoyou are on a well, it is advisable to get the water professionally tested to ensure its safety. Different regions may have varying tastes in water, and some impurities can be removed through processes such as chlorination, reverse osmosis, filtration, ozonation (for taste), and distillation. In case of water safety concerns, the water supplier is obligated to notify consumers through various means like newspapers, mail, radio, TV, or hand-delivery. They will provide information on any precautions needed, such as boiling water. If there's a waterborne disease emergency, the notice will outline necessary actions. In emergencies, boiling water for one minute can kill disease-causing germs, and alternative methods like household bleach or iodine can be used following specific directions provided by the EPA."

        "question": "what are foods that raise hdl cholesterol level?",
        "answers": [
            "HDL cholesterol is a good cholesterol therefore, yoyou should worry about your LDL bad cholesterol. Diet and exercise are an excellent first step to lower cholesterol. Yoyou should talk to your family doctor that will help yoyou to choose your diet carefully and please read the information on these sites. Lifestyle Changes Exercise: Although not everyone can run, burning between 1,200 and 1,500 calories each week doing aerobic exercise can have dramatic results. Not only is exercising a wonderful way to keep your heart healthy, it also helps lose weight, which is an additional benefit. By losing 10 pounds of excess weight, according to Kokkinos, \"That's where yoyou see significant increases in your HDL cholesterol.\" Avoid Trans Fatty Acids: Avoid trans fatty acid containing foods such as French fries, cookies, cakes and many of the fried fast foods. Minimize Carbohydrates: Minimize carbohydrates by avoiding sugar, flour, potatoes and white rice. Studies prove that HDL level drops dramatically when blood sugar is spiked by carbohydrates. Avoid Cholesterol Foods: Minimize the food sources of cholesterol such as egg yolk, liver, kidney, brains, etc. Stop Smoking: According to a study at Vanderbilt, within just one week of quitting smoking, HDL levels raised by seven points. HDL or Good Cholesterol Foods Red Wine: Drinking red wine is yet another option as long as it is consumed within reason. \"There are antioxidants contained in red wines such as cabernet sauvignon, Merlot, and pinot noir, that help slow down the oxidation of HDL and LDL cholesterol\", according to Vincent Rifici of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. What was shown is not that the HDL was higher than those not drinking, but that the HDL contained higher levels of several types of blood fats, thus giving the positive result. There is still a lot more research required but this could prove to be a wonderful option. Orange Juice: There was one specific study conducted at the University of Western Ontario in Canada where 25 students drank orange juice every day for four week. The results were amazing. HDL was raised an astounding 21%. The individual leading this study, Elzbieta Kurowska, stated this increase might have been caused by the flavonoid in the orange juice. Beans: Kidney and red beans are a wonderful choice for raising HDL. These foods are low-glycemic carbohydrates that during digestion do not cause insulin spikes. Studies conducted where people ate foods rich in low-glycemic carbohydrate measure with the highest level of HDL. Fish: Fish eaten several times a week can also be beneficial in raising HDL since it contains omega-3 fatty acids. This fish would include sardines, salmon, sea bass, herring, etc. If yoyou do not like to eat fish, fish oil can be used as a supplement although the benefit takes much longer. Olive Oil: Use oils higher in mono-unsaturated fats, such as olive oil or canola oil. Including 1-2 teaspoons of olive or canola oil with each meal would be sufficient. Oat bran: Lowers cholesterol and LDL and raises HDL. In one study, two ounces of oat bran per day was associated with a 16% lowering of LDL and, after 3 months, an increase in HDL of as much as 15% (JAMA. 1991. 285. 1833-1839). Onions: Some research suggests that half of raw onion/day may raise HDL as much as 30%. Soy Products: A 1995 meta-analysis of 38 studies of soy confirmed that it lowers total cholesterol, LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol, and triglycerides, and raises HDL (\"good\") cholesterol. Soluble Fiber: Add more soluble fiber to diet. Soluble fiber is found in fruits such as apples, grapes, and citrus fruits. The fiber in these foods helps lower total cholesterol and often raises HDL levels. Yoyou need to consume at least 30 grams of fiber per day. http://www.loweringcholesterol.net/show/raise-hdl-cholesterol http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4488"
        ],
        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, there are various lifestyle and dietary factors that can positively influence HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, commonly known as \"good\" cholesterol. Diet and exercise are highlighted as effective initial steps to lower cholesterol, with exercise aiding in weight loss\u2014a factor linked to significant increases in HDL levels. Notably, quitting smoking is associated with a rapid seven-point increase in HDL levels within just one week. Antioxidants in red wines, particularly cabernet sauvignon, Merlot, and pinot noir, are noted for slowing down the oxidation of both HDL and LDL cholesterol. Consuming foods rich in low-glycemic carbohydrates, such as beans and fish containing omega-3 fatty acids (sardines, salmon, sea bass, herring), is recommended for raising HDL. Additional suggestions include the use of olive oil, oat bran, and half a raw onion daily to positively impact cholesterol levels. A meta-analysis confirms the cholesterol-lowering benefits of soy. The advice extends to avoiding cholesterol-rich foods like egg yolk, liver, kidney, and brains, quitting smoking, and steering clear of trans fatty acid-containing foods. The inclusion of soluble fiber in the diet is also mentioned as a beneficial strategy."

            "They have a cure, but they cannot put it on the market because pharmaceautical companies would lose money. They always give chemo therapy which destroys cancer, but also destroys your body cells. If they found out that a certain tree bark can be used to cure cancer 90% of the time, they wouldnt say a word. They would just keep their mouths shut and continue administering drugs that prolong your life for another year and keep collecting on yoyou till yoyou die. There are medicines out there that can cure cancer even when doctors have given up. And its not a hit or miss thing. Up to 90% of cancer patients who have late stage cancer can still survive, even after doctors have given up on them. Chemo therapy, will not let yoyou live another 5 or 6 years even though the cancer is gone. what do yoyou live with if your body is deteriorated with their chemo? And the thing is, your body will deteriorate. If some people kill half of their cancer with chemo, what about the other half of your body cells? They die also. The other remedies that are on the market are not even allowed to post labels on their medicines. They can only be sold as health products and vitamins, and not a cure for cancer, even though they do cure cancer. Why is that then? Because if they were labled cancer medicine, people would flock over there to buy them. But, the government cant regulate these medicines. What if it was a mushroom that everybody can grow? See, the medical community wants to profit from yoyou till the day yoyou die. Do look up cesium chloride, green algae, oxygen drops, paw paw, and everything else that yoyou can dig up. Health vitamin websites and the like is where yoyou should start. There are even some doctors scattered across the USA who can almost garauntee that yoyou live, if its only 2nd stage cancer. They can even cure 3rd stage cancer at a 85%-90% survival rate, so what makes yoyou think they cant cure cancer? There are some chinese herbs, but, I suggest yoyou look up cesium chloride and oxygen drops first."
        ],
        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, the argument posits that a cure for cancer exists but is withheld from the market due to pharmaceutical companies' profit motives. The critique extends to chemotherapy, emphasizing its destructive impact on both cancer and healthy cells, with alternative remedies purported to have up to a 90% success rate in late-stage cancer cases. The claim suggests a deliberate suppression of information about these remedies, preventing them from being labeled as cancer medicine to avoid regulatory scrutiny. The narrative contends that the medical community prioritizes profit over patient well-being, and urges individuals to explore alternative treatments such as cesium chloride, green algae, oxygen drops, paw paw, and other options available on health vitamin websites. While acknowledging the complexity of cancer as a diverse family of diseases, the tone implies skepticism toward mainstream medical practices and encourages investigation into alternative therapies. However, it's essential to approach such claims critically and consult with healthcare professionals for informed decisions about cancer treatments."

If you're not drinking tap water because yoyou don't like the taste, then microwaving will do nothing - try adding some lemon? :) And there's no point in choosing bottled water over tap to try to be \"healthier\" - repeated studies have shown that bottled water is in absolutely no way more healthy than tap water. (Unless you're someplace with unsafe tap water of course).",

But as mentioned, public utility water in the US is chlorinated to kill bacteria. The second concern is chemicals, including the chlorination added in cities. This is not helped by heat but a simple water filter that yoyou can screw on to your tap or a pitcher filter is quite effective at ridding these chemicals which can cause bad taste and smell. But these filters have no affect on bacteria which is why yoyou don't want to use them with river or lake water.",

        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, the information discusses different considerations when purifying water. If tap water is deemed unsafe, boiling it after bringing it to a full boil is recommended to eliminate bacteria. However, if the reason for avoiding tap water is the taste rather than safety, microwaving will not improve it. The advice emphasizes that choosing bottled water over tap water for perceived health benefits is unsupported by studies, unless tap water is genuinely unsafe. Purification concerns include bacteria and chemicals, with heat addressing the former but not the latter. Water filters are suggested for chemical removal, but they don't affect bacteria, making them unsuitable for untreated river or lake water. For public water systems in the USA, boiling is unnecessary, and long boiling may affect taste. Once cooled, tap water from the microwave can be consumed directly if the source is a regulated public or private water system."

        "question": "I'm tired all the time; I've tried getting different hours of sleep, but nothing helps. What should I do?",
        "answers": [
            "Persistent fatigue which is not alleviated by sleep is a characteristic of many chronic conditions. Debilitating fatigue can also occur without an obvious illness and, after six months, is classified as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Milder forms have been dubbed \u2018TATT\u2019 (tired all the time). Fatigue can often be traced back to a viral infection, but this may not be the only culprit. It usually results from a combination of several factors, such as poor diet, overwork, a viral or bacterial infection, bereavement, stress, physical exhaustion, exposure to toxins etc. Its does not respond readily to modern drugs, so many sufferers turn towards alternative and complementary medicine in their quest for a solution. The treatment strategy which has worked with my patients is to close all possible avenues where diet or lifestyle may be inadequate by using a multi-dimensional approach. This means making an effort to ensure an above-average nutrient-intake by eating a healthy diet coupled with taking a range of good-quality supplements. In addition, I prescribe herbal medicine with immune-stimulating properties. Nutrition It is especially important for people with fatigue to choose a healthy diet. However, even when eating in this way, a person with fatigue may not reach daily nutrient-intake targets because of poor absorption and poor appetite due to lack of exercise. Hence, nutrient supplementation is an important, essential strategy to augment a healthy diet. A supplement programme for fatigue should start with a basic \u2018multi\u2019. This will provide most of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body at essential requirement levels. However, it will not contain enough calcium and magnesium, because these are required in much higher quantities than will fit into a single \u2018multi\u2019. Extra calcium will be required if fewer than three portions of dairy products are eaten per day. More magnesium is required if the intake of wholegrains, nuts, beans and seeds is low. (In fact, magnesium deficiency is very common in fatigue.) It is best to take these two minerals together in a good bone formula in the ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium A group of symptoms often accompanying fatigue is related to inflammation. This shows up as catarrh, skin rash, dry skin or eadaches. There are two approaches to reduce inflammation: increasing intake of (a) antioxidants and (b) omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Therefore, extra vitamin C is likely to be useful. For optimal nutrition, take at least 500mg daily as a supplement which, again, is much higher than will go into a single \u2018multi\u2019 tablet. I have written about the importance of getting the right balance of essential fatty acids in a previous Healthspan magazine.5 For fatigue sufferers, as well as having anti-inflammatory properties, it is the direct benefit that omega-3 fatty acids have on boosting normal immune function that is particularly important. Herbs For those with CFS, herbal medicine seems to have a very special role in normalising the immune system, which cannot be effected by essential nutrients alone. In fact, the more severe and persistent the fatigue, the more important it seems to be to augment the nutritional approach above with immune-supportive herbs. Since herbal treatments for CFS have to be individually prescribed, a visit to a professional is necessary. Contact the College of Practitioners (01424 776780) or the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (01392 426022) to find a registered herbal practitioner in your area. Herbal prescriptions normally include those with outspoken traditional use for supporting the immune and nervous systems. St John\u2019s Wort is particularly useful, since it appears to act in both domains. Echinacea, which can be used to help overcome exposure to viruses and to reduce the number of relapses, does not raise vitality in the same way. Other vitality-raising herbs for immune support include astragalus, ashwaganda",

They occur in unusual circumstances and/or in patients who develop a water/salt disturbance or have underlying metabolic problems. Sometimes we see it in patients with psychiatric problems. Drinking 9 glasses/day is quite healthy and will not harm you.",
            "As we learned from the University of Florida's College of Health and Human Performance, there's a condition known as \"water intoxication,\" or hyponatremia, which isn't uncommon among marathoners and triathletes. As these athletes consume large amounts of water over the course of a race, blood plasma increases and dilutes the salt content of the blood. While this is happening, the athlete is also losing salt by sweating. Consequently, the amount of salt available to the body tissues decreases, and, over time, the loss interferes with brain, heart, and muscle function. According to the experts at iVillage, consumption of large amounts of water is often associated with obsessive-compulsive behaviors. When a person consumes too much of this good thing, essential electrolytes in the blood stream become diluted and affect the control of the heart beat. Healthy adults require approximately three quarts of fluid each day, half of which comes from food and half from beverages. Drinking 8 to 12 glasses a day should have your body working on all cylinders.",
            "The only way to drink too much water is if yoyou were to drink 1-2 gallons in like 10 minutes. What would happen is that your blood would thin too much and not be able to carry the normal functions like sending oxygen to the brain.

However, for most healthy adults, drinking 8 to 12 glasses a day is considered beneficial for overall well-being. It is emphasized that the risk of drinking too much water is low unless consumed in extremely excessive quantities, like 1-2 gallons in a short period, which could lead to thinning of the blood and interference with normal bodily functions.

            "Frankly smoking and drinking to me are idiotic. Polluting your body in such a manner, though it may be a personal choice, should be done in your own home, in your own room, where yoyou can not possibly interact with anyone else. The reason for this in my opinion, is that 2nd hand smoke from smoking kills just as much as regular smoking. And drinking puts others in danger from your wild attitude swings, to temper inflarments. Drinking and smoking both cause harm to the general public, so, i'm sorry, but to me both of them are wrong. If I were to choose which would be worse, i would say alchol. The main reason for this is that people who are 'knackered up' are very dangerous for a short period of time (untill they sober up) and are just fine untill they drink again. So, the problem is transitory. But due to that exact nature, it can become increasingly difficult to control a person who drinks quite a bit of booze. So this makes for an unpredictable person. Smoking, on the other hand, is a long term effect, and thus isn't considered a direct threat to most people. To me, however it is considered disrespectful, and a statment that yoyou want me to die. But, to others as the effects happen over a long period of time, and chances of it actually affecting your mental state to make yoyou hurt someone is rare, then it isn't considered as big a threat as drinking. I just dont condone either. To me, th ey are both wrong.",

Alchohol only hurts the person drinking it, and only if they drink a lot and often. However in some ways alchohol is considered worse - kids can smoke at any age, they just can't buy tabaco until they are 18. There are also a lot more people who are against alchohol as a moral issue than smoking. I think some people see smoking as a disgusting habit that makes everyone sick, but alchohol is actually considered by some something both potentially dangerous and immoral."

The belief is that both activities should be confined to private spaces due to the harm they can cause to others. Secondhand smoke from smoking is considered as harmful as direct smoking, and the unpredictable behavior caused by alcohol consumption poses dangers to those around the drinker. While both habits can harm the general public, the opinion leans toward alcohol being worse, mainly because of its short-term impact on behavior, making individuals temporarily dangerous. However, smoking's long-term effects, including secondhand smoke exposure and the risk of cancer, contribute to ongoing debates about the relative harms of each. The moral aspects also differ, with some seeing smoking as a disgusting habit affecting everyone, while alcohol is considered by some as both potentially dangerous and immoral. The debate includes factors such as age restrictions on purchasing tobacco and varying societal opinions on the morality of alcohol consumption."

            "Bipolar disorder appears to run in families. The rate of suicide is higher in people who have bipolar disorder than in the general population. In fact, people with bipolar disorder are about twice as likely to commit suicide as those suffering from major depression (12% to 6%). The rate of prevalence of bipolar disorder is roughly equal in men and women. Lifetime risk of bipolar I disorder is often quoted as around 1%, but when bipolar II is included the true rate may be around 4%.[13] More than two-thirds of people with bipolar disorder have at least one close relative with the disorder or with unipolar major depression, indicating that the disease has a heritable component. Studies seeking to identify the genetic basis of bipolar disorder indicate that susceptibility stems from multiple genes. Scientists are continuing their search for these genes using advanced genetic analytic methods and large samples of families affected by the illness. The researchers are hopeful that identification of susceptibility genes for bipolar disorder, and the brain proteins they code for, will make it possible to develop better treatments and preventive interventions targeted at the underlying illness process.",

Medication works, and they are constantly finding new drugs that work even better, and constantly improving their methods of determining how the brain works in a bipolar person.

            "Hi! I'm an Audiologist and work in an Ear, Nose and Throat Doctors' office. There are different kinds of ear infections. Swimmers ear is in the external ear canal and is typically treated with ear drops and keeping the ear dry. A middle ear infection is a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum and often accompanies a head cold, or in young children can occur during teething, or in infancy can even happen if the baby is bottle fed while laying flat. To relieve the discomfort, OTC pain relievers are usually recommended, and it often helps to apply heat, such as a hot water bottle, against the ear. If accompanied by fever, antibiotics are often prescribed and it is VERY important to administer them properly for the full dosage to ensure that ALL the bacteria have been killed. Otherwise, the bacteria can regrow and may become resistant to the milder antibiotics. If the infections keep coming back, or if the fluid doesn't drain even after the antibiotics have killed the bacteria, surgical options may be considered. This is especially true in the case of young children, if the decrease in hearing is not resolving because it can effect the child's speech development. The surgeon makes an incision in the eardrum, draws out the fluid, cleans the middle ear space, and usually places a tube through the incision. The tube simply maintains an opening through the ear drum to maintain equal air pressure in the middle ear. Most tubes are designed to fall out of the eardrum as the healing process occurs -- usually about six months after surgery. The surgery is very common and is done as a same-day procedure in most cases, only because the space is so small that the patient must be very still. With adults, many specialists will perform the surgery in their office using only a local anestetic. If the child snores a lot or has other trouble breathing or frequent sore throats then inflammed or enlarged adenoids or tonsils may be blocking the Eustacian tube and preventing the fluid from draining. My son had chronic ear infections as an infant, even though he was breastfed and I was diligent about administering his medications properly. His father had ear infections his whole life, so I guess he just inherited the tendancy for ear infections from his dad. His first set of tubes was around his first birthday. The hardest part was not feeding him before and after -- he was so mad and he didn't understand. Another set of tubes and an adenoisectomy were done when he was five. Then he started getting frequent throat ifections so we had to remove the tonsils a couple years later. He's now 14 and only gets earaches occasionally. An inner ear infection often causes dizziness and sometimes ringing in the ear and/or sudden hearing loss. If there is a sudden onset of such symptoms it is important to see a specialist ASAP, because the sooner one starts treatment, the better the cance of recovery.",
            "first of all do not get any water in there. cover your ear with cotton. any more water in there will add to the infection, and feed on it.Yoyou can go to the drug store and get ear drops, and first warm up the bottle in a cup of warm water.

Inner ear infections can cause dizziness, ringing in the ear, and sudden hearing loss. If adenoids or tonsils obstruct the Eustachian tube, surgical intervention may be necessary.

Eye degeneration is often caused by those who are exposed to strained eyesight. If your eyes are constantly straining to see something, think of getting evaulated for eyeglasses, or a better perscription, or even laser surgery to fix your eyes to a proper state. As i've said before, if your eyes are straining, it is your body telling yoyou that 1. your eyes need a break, and 2. yoyou may need to get your eyes checked."

It sounds as if your wife might have been keeping the truth about her condition from yoyou for fear of the very reactions I'm feeling from the tone of your question. (Not seeking to blame you, dude, just getting the vibe.) Right now, what she needs most is support and understanding. Please read on... Herpes is a virus that is not just limited to the genital region. Cold sores around the mouth are caused by the herpes simplex virus - type 1 (HSV-1 or gingivostomatitis). HSV-1 is usually transmitted from person to person by saliva or direct contact. Genital herpes is most often caused by the herpes simplex virus - type 2 (HSV-2), and is usually transmitted person to person by intimate contact. Still, herpes is not limited to just the genital area. A person can experience outbreaks and lesions on other areas of the skin as well. Shingles is related to herpes. Shingles (otherwise known as Herpes Zoster) is a painful, blistering rash caused by the chickenpox (varicella) virus, which affects only a limited area of skin, and makes yoyou feel surprisingly tired, run down, and even depressed. Yoyou can only get shingles if yoyou have previously had chickenpox. After having chickenpox the virus lies dormant in the nerves, and shingles occurs when it is revitalised in one particular nerve to the skin. This would explain the way it affects a clearly demarcated band of skin only. Zovirax, Acyclovir, and Valtrex are common medications prescribed for both HSV-2 and shingles. Women are in a more difficult position with genital herpes because they may not notice early symptoms of the disease given the natural hidden nature of their genitals. This makes it very easy to pass to their partner. Still, there are many people out there today that have herpes and don't even know it! Best for yoyou is to see a doctor yourself if yoyou haven't done so already. I expect that your wife is feeling a lot of guilt about possibly passing on the virus to you, and that may be the biggest source of her issues regarding your marriage. If yoyou two can work past this, you'll both be stronger. I'm speaking from experience. Been there, did that."

            "ENERGY NEEDS The primary concern for the vegetarian athlete is obtaining adequate energy and protein, the group most at risk of this is the vegan. As in all athletes, needs for energy and protein are higher than the non-athlete. A high carbohydrate diet is essential to optimize muscle glycogen stores, which are the preferred source of energy during prolonged activity. Usually protein intake in the vegetarian athlete is lower than the meat-eating athlete and carbohydrate will then need to be 60-65 percent of total calories so protein is not used for energy. Depending on the activity and duration 6-10 grams (gm) of carbohydrate per kilogram (1 kg) (1 kg = 2.2 pounds) of body weight is practiced. This will spare protein from being used as an energy source, carbohydrates in the vegetarian diet come from whole grains, beans and legumes (which are also a protein source), fruits, vegetables and dairy if the athlete is not a vegan.",
            "eat more protein",
            "Most nutritionists claim that a diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables but low in animal fat and red meat offers numerous health benefits, including a significantly lower risk of heart disease, cancer, renal failure and stroke. The American Dietetic Association, the largest organization of nutrition professionals , states on its website \"Vegetarian diets offer a number of nutritional benefits, including lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, fiber, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals. Vegetarians have been reported to have lower body mass indices than nonvegetarians, as well as lower rates of death from ischemic heart disease; vegetarians also show lower blood cholesterol levels; lower blood pressure; and lower rates of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and prostate and colon cancer.\" [9] [10] The American Heart Association's website states \"Many studies have shown that vegetarians seem to have a lower risk of obesity, coronary heart disease (which causes heart attack), high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and some forms of cancer.\" [11] Studies show that a vegetarian mother's breast milk has significantly lower levels of pesticide residue than a non-vegetarian's. Some vegetable protein sources lack in one or more \"essential\" amino acid. For example, Grains and nuts are low in lysine and legumes are low in methionine. While everyone should eat a variety of foods to ensure a balanced nutrition, the body\u2019s requirement for essential amino acids now appears to be much less important than researchers once believed. Vegetarians get all the protein and amino acids they need from eating a normal variety of whole grains (whole wheat bread, oatmeal, brown rice), beans, nuts, and soy (tofu, veggie burgers/hotdogs, edamame, etc). The intake of such foods has to be larger since the protein percentage in these foods are comparatively lower than in a similar serving of meat. Attaining sufficient protein intake is rarely a problem in developed countries and the lower protein intake of vegetarians has even been suggested as a possible cause of some of the health benefits above. A vegetarian diet does not include fish - a major source of Omega 3, though some plant-based sources of it exist such as soy, hempseed, pumpkin seeds, canola oil and, especially, walnuts and flaxseed. Some suggest that vegetarians have higher rates of deficiencies in those nutrients which are found in high concentrations in meat. Surprisingly, studies endorsed by the ADA found that this was not the case for iron or calcium. On the other hand, Vitamin B-12 and zinc from vegetarian sources other than dairy products and eggs are not readily absorbed by the body and a vegan diet usually needs supplements. [12]. Nonetheless, these nutrients are now commonly supplemented in milks and cereals in the western world, and is not necessarily a problem in a vegetarian diet.",

Otherwise, they wont say a word. And if yoyou dont know, how can yoyou ask? So, the doctors lips are sealed tight. The individual doctors on the other hand are sometimes scared to talk about it. It is because, if they open their mouths, they would be facing the whole medical community. Alot of them go into the medical field to help people, and some go in it for money. But, the top ranking ones in control are all in it for money. If not, they would have never gotten their position. I do not suggest yoyou go with chemo therapy. Yoyou can look up some alternative medicine to cancer and they are all over the place on the net. The best ranked one is cesium chloride, paw paw, and along with others. Some health websites even have a place where yoyou can go and tell them your stage of cancer and which type of cancer, and they will sell yoyou a package based on your individual problem. There are also some doctors scattered all over the USA who specialize in cancer. Yoyou never hear about them right? Well, they wont be bothered by the medical community if they do a small operation without much advertising. But, they all report about 90% survival rates on cancers that regular cancer doctors give up on. And if that doctor didnt give up, do yoyou expect to live anyways? No. I speak out to yoyou because I dont want yoyou to die like the two of my friends who have already died. Certain doctors even said that they could cure it with 80% survival rate. But, I didnt have the money to help them. So, I am speaking out in hopes that nothing happens to yoyou and yoyou survive. Regardless of your stage of cancer. Cesium chloride is what works best. Look it up, its everywhere. Even oxygen drops help. Yoyou can use them both at the same time. The thing is with these alternatives is that, some of them make yoyou feel extremely bad at the beginning, but after a while yoyou get used to it, and then yoyou are gone with the cancer before yoyou know it. So dont feel discouraged. Oxygen drops keep cancer from growing because your body can live with more oxygen. As a matter of fact, it helps circulate your blood. Cancer cannot live at the sight of oxygen. It has been said that not enough oxygen is what causes cancer. I dont know what the cause is, because there are many causes. But, cesium chloride and oxygen drops will take care of it. And one more thing, some of these remedies cannot be sold as a cancer treatment. So, they are sold as vitamins. But, in their website, they are allowed to say what it cures. But, their labels cannot say a word about cancer. So, yoyou should start in the vitamin section of the internet. Good luck my friend.",

Stress, poor diet(acidic foods such as coffee, chocolate (sorry) meats and vinegars can add to the problem) or any bacterial infection could be contributing to these sores. If it's cold sores(on the mouth), LYSINE pills are good for suppressing viruses(herpes simplex). There are also LYSINE balms for this topically. For Canker sores, soothing and healing the stomach lining helps. Yoyou can look into is DGL-deglycerrized licorice. This excellent supplement helps heal the stomach lining which can then help with canker sores. I used to get them all the time...I also had constant stomach aches due to stress! So maybe this will help?? Teas made from mucalents like slippery elm, marshmallow can help soothe the stomach. Ginger is also good for the stomach. As far as the sore itself, avoid acidic foods, keep the mouth clean. Goldenseal powder(yuck but effective) is a good natural antibacterial/biotic to heal wounds. Use a little on the wound once a day.

Yoyou cant expect everyone to have a job, because as soon as somebody gets hired, that job is unavailable for everybody else. Many people feel that not working is immoral, It was,thousands of years ago when everybody in a tribe had to do his share of the work, or they would'nt have enough food, but now a few percent of the population can produce enough food to feed everyone. Its not hard to make enough of something now, the challenge is to sell it. In America most of the real work is done by machines, women, and people who are not U.S. citizens, including people who make things for us overseas. We dont need people to do more work. Most american companies have too many employees, and can increase profits by laying off redundant workers. Yes, there are want ads,and there are jobs available, but they're not going to hire a bum when they can hire someone who gets his work done. If there was a job sharing program where yoyou would share your job with an unemployed person, and yoyou each worked every other day and yoyou each got half of your salary. would yoyou participate? Perhaps \"professional bum\" is a term that means an unemployed man who will never get a job and does'nt look for one. Bums believe that nobody wants them. They get this idea when they get fired from jobs, and they dont succeed in getting another job. To stop being a bum, a man must believe that he is'nt really a bum, and there is a job somewhere that is easy enough that he can do it, and someone who will want him as an employee. He must believe in himself, or nobody else will. He needs a family that does'nt perceive him as a bum, or acts like they dont."

The perspective challenges the notion that everyone must have a job in a world where job opportunities are limited and not everyone can be employed. The historical connection between work and morality is acknowledged, but the changing landscape, with automation and global production, has altered the dynamics of employment. The argument suggests that many American companies already have excess employees, and the challenge is not to create more work but to sell products efficiently. The idea of job sharing is proposed, emphasizing the importance of self-belief for individuals labeled as \"bums\" to overcome the perception that they are unwanted or unemployable. The narrative encourages a shift in societal attitudes and the importance of family support in helping individuals regain confidence and find employment."

Avoid stress and anxiety. Stress may cause psoriasis to appear suddenly (flare) or can make symptoms worse, although this has not been proven in studies. Avoid infection.

This is due to the inabilty of your kidneys to remove excess water from your blood. This can cause difficuly breathing. 3rd yoyou could have an increased potassium level from your kidneys inability to eliminate the extra potassium your body doesn't need that is in the food yoyou eat. An increased potassium level can cause your heart to beat irregularly and yoyou could have a heart attack.

There are two main choices yoyou have for dialysis (this is assuming that yoyou don't change your mind about a transplant). Yoyou can have hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis takes between 3 to 5 hours 3 times per week. There are several people who still even continue to work while they use this option. Others do nocturnal dialysis where they dialyze 8 hours at night 3 times per week. Even more of those people work. Peritoneal dialysis is where yoyou dialyze at home by using special bags of fluid that are prescribed by a doctor. Many people that choose this option have a high quality of life.

The term was coined in the first half of the 20th century. The abnormal histologic aspects of the tissue included the presence of islet cell enlargement, islet cell dysplasia, beta cells budding from ductal epithelium, and islets in apposition to ducts. By the 1970s, nesidioblastosis was primarily used to describe the pancreatic dysfunction associated with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism and in most cases from the 1970s until the 1970s, it was used as a synonym for what we now refer to as congenital hyperinsulinism. The term fell into disfavor after it was recognized in the late 1980s that the characteristic tissue features were sometimes seen in pancreatic tissue from normal infants and even adults, and is not consistently associated with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Most congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by different mechanisms than excessive proliferation of beta cells in a fetal pattern.

The symptoms of flesh-eating disease include a high fever, and a red, severely painful swelling that feels hot and spreads rapidly. The skin may become purplish and then die. There may be extensive tissue destruction. Sometimes the swelling starts at the site of a minor injury, such as a small cut or bruise, but in other cases there is no obvious source of infection. Flesh-eating disease can be caused by a number of different bacteria, including group A streptococcus (GAS). GAS is a very common bacteria. Many people carry it in the throat or on their skin without getting sick. It is the same bacteria that causes strep throat, and can also cause impetigo, scarlet fever and rheumatic fever. In rare instances, GAS will cause serious illnesses, including pneumonia, meningitis, blood poisoning (bacteremia), streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome and flesh-eating disease. Few people who come into contact with GAS will develop a serious disease. The bacteria are normally spread through close personal contact, such as kissing or sharing cutlery with someone who is infected. People who are ill, such as those with strep throat or skin infections, are most likely to spread the bacteria. People who carry the bacteria, but have no symptoms, are much less contagious."

It's all about your own spirituality or lack of such. Since yoyou know you're behaving as a co-dependent, yoyou probably feel as yoyou mentioned in your question, that it's easier to do it and hope it will all just disappear. That's a childish way of thought. Nothing as serious as drug or alcohol abuse will 'just go away'. If it were that simple, people would stop using when they found it didn't bring the joy they once hoped for. We need to learn the steps to self-love and relinquishing control as a beginning. Yoyou control your wife by fulfilling her need for pain-killers. If yoyou didn't do that, do yoyou fear deep down that she might leave you, or at least not acknowledge yoyou as yoyou wish? If yoyou truly loved yourself, yoyou wouldn't feel that needy because yoyou would be happy with only yourself, if that's what the outcome would be to refusing to help your wife get what she wants.

According to the National Pest Control Association cockroaches can contaminate food and transmit disease carrying organisms, including staphylococci, strep, colform molds, salmonella, yeast\u2019s and clostridia. They also spread parasites that cause toxoplasmosis, an illness that can causes birth defects if the pregnant women gets infected. Cockroaches spread disease by carrying contaminated organisms onto your countertop or onto your leftout food. Roaches will eat animal and human feces, rotten and contaminated food, book bindings, leather, and even the glue on canned food labels. They like the glue in paper bags and can be transported from grocery store to homes via the bags. There are 4 types of cockroaches. The German Cockroach; the most common and the smallest of the species. American Cockroach; light brown with yellowish wings, can\u2019t really fly, but glides. Oriental Cockroach; dark reddish brown. Brown Banded Cockroach; yellowish or brown with brown bands on wings. Cockroaches can grow to be 2 inches long. As for reproduction, all cockroaches produce offspring the same way. The females produce 20 to 30 egg capsules per cycle, each containing between 15 and 40 eggs. Females can have up to 30,000 offspring in their lifetime. Cockroaches like dark, moist, warm places to live in. The kitchen and bathroom fit this description but so do other places like laundry baskets. They will also live in boxes, paperbags and books. It is easy to transport them from house to house and even across oceans. Prevention and control are important in the fight to eliminate cockroaches. Killing only the ones yoyou see is not effective, because if yoyou see one there is 300 in hiding. To eliminate them in your house yoyou have to get rid of their food and water, eliminate the present population with a poison and prevent future cockroaches from invading your house. Always plug drains on sinks when not in use. Cockroaches can\u2019t swim but they can come in through sewer pipes if the water has subsided. Keep counters, floors and cupboard free from food and crumbs. Insecticide sprays can be used to control cockroaches. Yoyou can call out a professional and pay for the service to your home. Yoyou can also spray yourself with an insecticide yoyou buy at a home center. Yoyou have to make sure yoyou get all the hiding places, cracks, crevices, baseboards and under sinks. yoyou can also place boric acid powder along the same places and then when a cockroach walks through it, it clings to their feet and antennae. When they ingest the powder it kills them. Boric acid is fairly safe to use and handle. Ingested in large quantities can make a human sick too. Cockroach bait houses are also effective as a supplement to spraying. Yoyou must prevent cockroaches from entering your house by sealing up any holes and cracks along baseboards, door frames and windows. Seal up the space around water and sewer pipes, and electrical and telephone lines where they come inside. Keep all piles of debris and mulches and compost piles away from your house. Spray the perimeter of your house frequently. Cockroaches are stow aways and will come into your house in boxes, bags, pet food cartons (cockroaches love dog food), appliances and laundry, so inspect them carefully.",

Strategies include eliminating food and water sources, using insecticide sprays, calling professionals for pest control, and sealing entry points to prevent their access.

        "question": "Help! Need big time reliable answers for bacterial infection that doesn't go away! Definately a system wide",
        "answers": [
            "Sounds like yoyou are motivated to find out what is wrong that is causing this problem. A doctor is always the best source of information for health issues. Perhaps yoyou should do some research, then go see a doctor. If yoyou are going in circles with the one yoyou are going to, then maybe yoyou should speak to a different one. Yoyou can still keep going to the same doctor yoyou are now. Yoyou do not have to switch doctors; yoyou are just getting an additional opinion. Hopefully yoyou are in a country where yoyou can see a gynocologist. If yoyou are, and they are not helping, maybe yoyou should see a general practitioner, mention all the symptoms yoyou are having and any other things yoyou might have going on now. Maybe they can point yoyou to a different type of specialist. If yoyou have a bacterial infection, and they are certain it is one, it seems odd they have not identified which one it is. I am certainly no doctor but it seems like they could do a bacteria culture of it in less than 7 months. Once it is identified, doctors frequently follow up by prescribing a course of antibiotics. Viruses generally do not respond to antibiotics but lots of types of bacteria do. The antibiotic must be matched to the particular bacteria though. Also, in addition to different species of bacteria, there are different strains of each species. They can reproduce quickly, have very short lifespans, and then die. This produces many generations in a much shorter time than humans - a lot faster that 20 years or so. What this means is they can evolve quickly. They can actually therefore adapt to certain medicines and develop resistence. This is a very simplified form of evolution, which is a very real phenomenon. I am not saying that yoyou have a strain that is resistant to a particular medicine. I am just pointing out it happens that some strains have evolved a little immunity to some medicines that normally work on other members of their species. With antibiotics, it is important to stick to the particular medicine your doctor has prescribed for you. Yoyou want to take it at the prescribed times/frequencies. Do not forget to take it or just stop taking it because yoyou do not think it is working. If for some reason yoyou cannot take it because for example, it is making yoyou incredibly ill - let your doctor know right away, so they can figure out what to do right then. They might want to switch yoyou to a different drug right then, or need yoyou to stay on it. If an antibiotic has made yoyou really sick, remember its name (write it down) so yoyou can tell a doctor the next time yoyou see one and he asks if yoyou are allergic or have had any problems from any particular medication. I am including some links to common conditions that occur in that area. The first few links are for yeast infections. They are pretty common. Not in the sense that yoyou will get them all the time but in the sense that most women have it at least once in their lifetime. That kind of common. It is something that just sort of pops up under the right conditions, according to the web pages I found about it. Yoyou can read how/why and so forth on them. Normally, it is not something people get because they caught it from someone else. In other words, they are not an STD. Yeast is all around us in the environment. It cannot infect someone unless conditions are just the right conditions for it to grow. Otherwise, well it would be like a pumpkin growing in the Saharah desert. Probably not going to happen, right? There are STDs around that people can catch from other people. Some are pretty common. Yoyou said yoyou do not have one, which is good. A lot of people do have them. A lot of people are spreading them. Infection rates vary per country and go up and down.

        "question": "how bad is it to crack your fingers? repeatedly? for years?",
        "answers": [
            "Cracking knuckles is the practice of manipulating one's fingers such that the hand (most usually the knuckle joint) produces a sharp sound, likened to cracking (also likened to popping, etc). To produce the sounds, many people will bend their fingers into unusual positions, or manipulate them in ways which are not commonly experienced in everyday use. For example, bending the fingers right back towards the back of the hand, or pulling them away from the hand. In many early motion pictures and subsequently parodied in animated cartoons, the gesture of cracking knuckles was associated with a \"tough guy\" image, especially when accompanied by the implicit or explicit threat of violence. The physical mechanism is unknown, but possibilities that have been suggested include: 1. cavitation within the joint - small cavities of partial vacuum form in the fluid then rapidly collapse, producing a sharp sound (hypothesis in a medical journal) 2. the sudden stretching of ligaments (hypothesis by one reader of that journal) 3. release of gas from the joints being adjusted (this applies to the popping that can occur in any joint such as during chiropractic manipulation) A single event is not enough to cause damage to the joint, although it is possible that prolonged joint stress due to cracking knuckles may eventually lead to a higher risk of joint damage. The long-term consequences of this practice have not been studied thoroughly, and the scientific evidence is inconclusive. However, the common parental advice \"Cracking your knuckles gives yoyou arthritis\" may be simply a device to deter children from this practice, which many people find annoying because of the sound it makes. In actual fact, study by Castellanos and Axelrod showed that arthritis was not a product of knuckle cracking. They evaluated 300 consecutive outpatients at Mount Carmel Mercy Hospital to determine whether habitual knuckle cracking is a risk factor for hand dysfunction. They found no relation with osteoarthritis, but noted that 'knuckle crackers were more likely to have hand swelling and lower grip strength' A chiropractic perspective: \"As a joint is being distracted, the capsule invaginates inward and as the stress on the capsule reaches a certain threshold, it suddenly snaps back from the synovial fluid, increasing the volume of the capsule (and decreasing pressure) and causing the audible sound. The sudden increase in the volume causes the tension to drop, allowing the joint to increase in movement. Eventually, the elastic limit of the capsule is reached and the process stops. The time elapsed during all this is shorter than that required for completion of the stretch reflex, so it can occur without muscular resistance. The sudden jerk on the capsule and the other periarticular tissues is theorized to cause firing of the high-threshold mechanoreceptors.\"",
            "What's really happening when yoyou \"crack\" your knuckles is that yoyou are either pushing the joint back into or out of its normal position. Joints are the meeting points of two separate bones which are held together by connecting tissues and ligaments. A thick, clear lubricant (made mostly of carbon dioxide and some nitrogen) called synovial fluid is found between the bones. When yoyou stretch or pull your finger to get that desired popping noise, yoyou are causing the bones to pull apart. Pressure is reduced on the synovial fluid and bubbles form that quickly expand and then burst - which is why yoyou get that noise So no harm in cracking",

It will tell your doctor how much inflammation the virus is causing. With long term inflammation (over years - usually 10-20 years) inflammation can cause fibrosis. Extensive fibrosis can result in liver function decline. Over time, cirrhosis (extensive fibrosis) can lead to serious complications requiring a liver transplant.

To counteract this, it's essential to create a calorie deficit by burning more calories through activities like squats and deadlifts than those consumed. While the process may be gradual, building muscle in the legs and back can contribute to effective fat control. This challenges the idea of a slowed metabolism during calorie restriction, emphasizing the significance of a balanced approach to weight management through both diet and exercise."

            "Here are some suggestions, but it would be best to talk to your doctor first to see what he recommends. Avoid movements and positions that increase pain or numbness. Limit your activities, and try briefly resting your back if your pain is severe. Try taking short walks and doing light activities that do not cause pain. Then gradually start your regular activities. Even if yoyou have severe pain, bed rest of more than a few days can cause the muscles in your back\u2014as well as the rest of your body\u2014to become weaker. Use ice or heat to relieve pain. Apply ice 3 times a day. Do not use ice for longer than 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Heat relieves pain for some people, but it should not be used too soon after an injury. Ask your health professional about using ice and heat to reduce your pain. Take nonprescription pain relievers to help reduce pain. Examples include aspirin (such as Bayer), acetaminophen (such as Tylenol), ibuprofen (such as Motrin), and naproxen sodium (such as Aleve). Exercising may help speed your recovery, prevent reinjury to your back, and reduce the risk of disability from back pain. Other steps that will keep your back strong and healthy include losing weight if yoyou are overweight, and quitting smoking if yoyou smoke.",

Yoyou wouldn't believe how much weight yoyou have carrying your waste around, as gross as that sounds X( 3) Running, as far as yoyou can I would suggest.

As for losing weight and/or looking thinner, yoyou can always dress lighter, because the positive space from the bright clothing looks much less than dressing in black, where the space yoyou take up could be better seen.

        "answers": [
            "The simple statistic for any type of dietary pill is: 30% actually absorbed into the body. 70% is usually discarded as waste. That is why the pills are so 'strong', they contain huge amounts of a specific chemical, so that 30% of that chemical can actually make an effect on the body. The problem with many of these pills is that they are not tested by the FDA and are not considered wholey safe to use. I've used many, and none work. Pills such as Leptoprin, Leptopril, Thyrin ATC, ect, all have good chemicals in them; under clinical trials, they work great; but under clinical trials they are not administered as pills, but as a liquid, or injection shot. THus making 100% of their content absorbed. If yoyou really want to loose weight, do some good eating, some good excersie. If yoyou are on medication that makes yoyou gain weight (LIKE MINE: PROZAC), then talk to your doctor about other medication options. If yoyou are mobridly obese, ie your BMI (body mas index) is more than 45-80, then most doctors reccomend some sort of bariatric proceedure, in which your stomach is manipulated to only absorb 1000-1500 calories a day. However, that is a last step, and should be considered as most drastic to loose weight. Diet pills, do not work. In fact, the vast majority of them say to follow up with some sort of excersie and additional eating. Some pillls would have yoyou skip meals, and replace it with a dietary suppliment. This is never reccomended because the body needs 3-6 small meals a day. We neeed the continued nutrition and energy that comes from our food. Taking suppliments, diet pills, ect, isn't a good way to obtain this type of nutrition. Again, looking at the amount of pill that is REMOVED from the body, yoyou can easily see that they are ineffective. Liquid suppliments, ect, are way more effective, with a graded curve of 80% to 92% effectiveness. The reason for this is that it is easilly digestable by the body. Liquid suppliments, however, are usualy more expensive, and are often regulated by the FDA because of their effectiveness. Good luck :)"

The most reliable weight loss methods involve proper diet and exercise. Medications causing weight gain can be discussed with a doctor for alternatives. Severe obesity may prompt consideration of bariatric procedures, limiting calorie absorption. Diet pills are generally ineffective and often recommend supplementary measures. Skipping meals with pill replacements is discouraged, as the body needs regular nutrition. Liquid supplements, although more effective (80-92%), can be pricier and are FDA-regulated for their efficacy."

        "question": "Is there any cure for celiac disease?",
        "answers": [
            "Diagnosis Tests The gold standard test for coeliac disease is still upper endoscopy with biopsy of the distal duodenum or jejunum. To avoid false negative results, the first endoscopy must be done while the patient is on a normal, gluten-containing diet or very shortly after going on a gluten-free diet. Sometimes the endoscopy is repeated after the patient has been on a gluten-free diet, in order to ensure that the bowel has healed. However, upper endoscopy always carries a risk of false negative results. This is because coeliac disease may or may not damage villi throughout the entire small intestine, and upper endoscopy only examines the upper part of the intestine. In a patient whose intestinal damage is located further down, the biopsy may come back negative. If the endoscopy is positive the diagnosis is confirmed, but if it is negative, the diagnosis is not necessarily excluded. Serology has been proposed as a screening measure, because the presence in the blood of IgA antibodies reactive against gluten and tissue transglutaminase is indicative of coeliac disease. Like the endoscopy, these tests are not accurate in patients who have been on a gluten-free diet for some time; they must be performed while the person is on a normal diet or within a relatively short time after eliminating gluten. A thorough workup includes four tests: Anti-tissue Transglutaminase Antibody (tTG), IgA. This test is sometimes used alone. If this test is positive it is highly likely that the patient has celiac disease. tTG test is not reliable in children before the age of 2. Anti-Gliadin Antibodies (AGA), IgG and IgA. These tests are often useful when testing young symptomatic children, but they are found in fewer coeliacs than Anti-tTG, and their presence does not automatically indicate coeliac disease because they are found in some other disorders. Some people have an IgA deficiency that causes a false negative test; due to this and other factors, the IgA test has a relatively high rate of false negatives. Anti-Endomysial Antibodies (EMA), IgA. This test is being replaced by the Anti-tTG test because both tests measure the autoantibodies that cause the tissue damage associated with coeliac disease. Many physicians still order this test. This test as tTG test is also not reliable in children before the age of 2. Anti-Reticulin Antibodies (ARA), IgA. Anti-ARA is not ordered as frequently as it once was, because it is less sensitive and less specific than the other tests. It is found in about 60% of people with coeliac disease and 25% of those with dermatitis herpetiformis. Many doctors will not consider positive blood tests as definitive proof of coeliac disease, but will still require biopsy confirmation. A growing minority consider coeliac disease to be diagnosed where the patient has positive blood tests and shows improved symptoms after the adoption of a gluten-free diet. Because upper endoscopies are uncomfortable, expensive, and may produce false negative results, this group of doctors considers serology tests and a positive response to eliminating gluten from the diet to be sufficient for diagnosis. A small minority of doctors advocate gluten-free diets even for symptom-free patients who have not had an endoscopy but have had a positive blood test, because some confirmed coeliacs are completely symptom-free throughout their lives; in symptom-free patients, the purpose of the diet is to avoid nutritional deficiencies, osteoporosis, and intestinal lymphoma. Other tests that may assist in the diagnosis are a full blood count, electrolytes, renal function and liver enzymes. Coagulation testing may be useful to identify deficiency of vitamin K, which predisposes patients to hemorrhage.",
            "the only cure is to go on a gluten-free diet. then the health risks all return to normal, your body will heal and your symptoms will go away. it may sound hard at first, but for me, going gluten-free was like having my life handed back to me. go to celiac.com and find out what foods/ingredients are forbidden and get started! it is SO worth it to not feel sick, to have energy, and to be able to eat w/o pain and misery! best of luck to you."

EMA and ARA tests are less common due to sensitivity and specificity issues. Some doctors rely on positive blood tests and symptom improvement on a gluten-free diet for diagnosis, while others insist on biopsy confirmation. A minority recommend gluten-free diets for asymptomatic patients with positive blood tests to prevent complications. Additional diagnostic tests include a full blood count, electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, and coagulation testing to identify vitamin K deficiency. This comprehensive approach aims to provide an accurate diagnosis and address potential health risks associated with celiac disease."

It doesnt matter if yoyou wear contacts or not. But, on the flip side, yoyou might need to see a doctor beacause the tear ducts might be a bit small on your eyes so its a bit difficult to get moisture. What they do is shoot a laser right at the tear duct to open it up a bit. This is done almost painlessly. Its a slight burn for about an hour or two. At most it would be there till the next morning. But, without this procedure, yoyou might go blind early because there was not enough lubrication to protect your eyes and eyesight till your ripe age. So ask your doctor. In the mean time, those eye drops will work well.

This procedure helps open up the tear ducts, and although it may cause a slight burning sensation for a short period, it is generally painless.

Psoriasis affects nearly 6 million people in the US. What causes psoriasis? The cause of psoriasis is unknown, however, it is thought to be caused by abnormally fast-growing and shedding skin cells. The skin cells multiply so quickly, causing the skin to shed every 3 to 4 days. Though not contagious, the condition is hereditary. Psoriasis is often recurrent and occurs in varying severities. What are the symptoms of psoriasis? The following are the most common symptoms of psoriasis. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently, as psoriasis comes in several forms and severities. Symptoms may include: discoid psoriasis Also called plaque psoriasis, this type of psoriasis is the most common. Symptoms may include patches of red, raised skin on the trunk, arms, legs, knees, elbows, genitals, and scalp. Nails may also thicken, become pitted, and separate from the nail beds. guttate psoriasis This type of psoriasis affects mostly children. Symptoms may include many small patches of red, raised skin. A sore throat usually proceeds the onset of this type of psoriasis. pustular psoriasis Symptoms may include small pustules (pus-containing blisters) all over the body or just on the palms, soles, and other small areas. The symptoms of psoriasis may resemble other dermatologic conditions. Consult a physician for diagnosis. How is psoriasis diagnosed? When the condition progresses to the development of silvery scales, the physician can usually diagnose psoriasis with a medical examination of the nails and skin. Confirmation of diagnosis may be done with a skin biopsy -- taking a small skin specimen to examine under a microscope. Treatment for psoriasis: The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation and slow down the rapid growth and shedding of skin cells. At the present time, there is no cure for psoriasis. Specific treatment for psoriasis will be determined by your physician based on: your overall health, age, and medical history severity of the condition your tolerance of specific medications, procedures, or therapies your opinion or preference Treatment may include one, or a combination, of the following: ointments and creams to moisturize the skin sunlight or ultraviolet light exposure (under a physician's supervision) steroids such as cortisone creams vitamin D cream creams containing salicylic acid or coal tar Anthralin (a drug that treats the thicker, hard-to-treat patches of psoriasis) methotrexate (an anti-cancer drug that interrupts the growth of skin cells)",

The water or solutions are held in a bottle and squirted into the vagina through tubing and a nozzle. Is douching safe? Health care providers do not recommend douching to clean the vagina. Douching changes the delicate chemical balance in the vagina (and the vaginal flora), which can make a woman more prone to bacterial infections. It also can spread existing vaginal or cervical infections up into the pelvic organs (uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries). Research shows that women who douche on a routine basis tend to have more problems than women who do not douche or who rarely douche. These problems include vaginal irritation, infections (called bacterial vaginosis or BV), and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Women who douche often are also more at risk for getting pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of a woman's pelvic organs. It is caused by bacteria, which can travel from a woman's vagina and cervix up into her pelvic organs. If left untreated, PID can lead to infertility (not being able to get pregnant) and ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus). Both BV and PID can lead to serious problems during pregnancy, such as infection in the baby, problems with labor, and early delivery.",

The city lies on three islands linked by dykes: the New Town, the Old Town and Bani. As a result it is sometimes known as the \"Venice of Mali\". The islands had long been inhabited, but Mopti was only founded in the nineteenth century as part of the Massina Empire, later becoming the base of El Hadj Umar Tall. With French domination, Mopti became known for its egret feather industry. It has continued to grow around its harbour and is Mali's most important port. It is also known for its fish and salt markets. Mopti is popular with tourists, having an active river port, a mosque, and across the Niger, small fishing villages. Attractions in Mopti include Mopti Grand Mosque. Ferries connect Mopti with Timbuktu, Gao, Koulikoro and Djenn\u00e9. The town is linked to S\u00e9var\u00e9, the actual location of Mopti's airport.

I take a supplement similar to the levels the Japanese consume. I had to buy it from the web, as most health food stores don't carry it (it's also used in making some illegal drugs). It has helped clear my sinuses amazingly well, after years of suffering from sinusitis. A side benefit is that it also helped kick in my thyroid function, so I have a lot more energy."

Also, stay away from work, school, or other places where yoyou might spread your ickyness. Not for too long, but remember there are other people out there (people with kids!) who will be very unhappy with yoyou if yoyou cramp their style by getting them sick. Keep the foods yoyou eat pretty bland (is this the rationale behind chicken soup and crackers?) so that yoyou don't put your digestive system through the ringer. The key is nice 'n easy. I am not sure of this, but I was always told to stay away from dairy products (milk, cheese, etc) as they contribute to the production of phlegm.

Take the time (when you're not sleeping) to catch up with movies, books, or online shopping (my personal favorite!) to keep yourself indoors.

        "answers": [
            "Treatment for OCD can include psychological treatments and medications. Psychological treatment can improve symptoms, and this improvement is often maintained in the long term. Cognitive behaviour therapy Cognitive behaviour therapy aims to change patterns of thinking, beliefs and behaviours that may trigger anxiety and obsessive compulsive symptoms. This therapy uses education to promote control over symptoms. The education includes information that helps to expose myths about the causes of OCD. Part of the therapy involves gradually exposing the person to situations that trigger their obsessions and, at the same time, helping them to reduce their compulsions and avoidance behaviours. This process is gradual and usually begins with the less feared situations. The exposure tasks and prevention of compulsions are repeated daily and consistently until anxiety decreases. Over time, this allows the person to rebuild trust in their capacity to manage and function, even with anxiety. Cognitive behavioural therapy should be undertaken with a skilled, specialist mental health professional. Over-use of alcohol, drugs and some medications may interfere with the success of this type of treatment. Anxiety management techniques Anxiety management techniques can help a person to manage their own symptoms. Such techniques can include relaxation training, slow breathing techniques, meditation and hyperventilation control. These techniques require regular practice and are most effective if used together with a cognitive behavioural treatment program. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy with a psychologist may assist the person with OCD to deal with issues and problems that have been caused or exacerbated by the disorder. Medication Some medications, especially antidepressants that affect the serotonin system, have been found to reduce symptoms of OCD. This medication can only be prescribed by a medical practitioner. Side effects of antidepressants may include nausea, headaches, dry mouth, blurred vision, dizziness and feeling sleepy. These effects often decline after the first few weeks of treatment. If your side effects are severe or last for a long time, yoyou should discuss this with your doctor. It usually takes several weeks for medication to deliver any effects. When reducing or stopping medication, the dose should be reduced slowly under medical supervision. Hospitalisation Assessment and treatment in hospital can be helpful for some people, particularly when they first begin treatment for OCD or when symptoms are severe. A stay in hospital may last from several days to a few weeks. Support groups and education Support groups allow people with OCD and their families to meet in comfort and safety, and give and receive support. The groups also provide the opportunity to learn more about the disorder and to develop social networks.",
            "Treating OCD is not an easy task. One of the most successful therapies involves placing a person in a situation that usually triggers his anxiety, but the patient is not allowed to engage in the compulsive behavior that is the typical response. The idea is that eventually the stress from not performing the compulsive behavior will lessen over time to the point where the person no longer feels compelled to do it. Prescription drugs have also proven successful in reducing a person's obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors; this approach will not necessarily resolve the problem entirely but will free a person to live a normal life while confronting the issues appropriately through therapy."
        ],
        "labelled_summary": "Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) poses challenges, but successful therapies involve exposing individuals to anxiety triggers without allowing them to engage in compulsive behaviors. Over time, the stress from refraining may diminish, reducing the compulsion. Prescription drugs, particularly antidepressants affecting the serotonin system, can alleviate obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, enabling individuals to lead normal lives while undergoing therapy. Psychological treatments like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) aim to change thinking patterns and behaviors through gradual exposure to triggering situations, helping manage anxiety. Anxiety management techniques, including relaxation and slow breathing exercises, complement cognitive behavioral treatment. Psychotherapy with a psychologist addresses issues arising from OCD, while medication should only be prescribed by a medical practitioner. Hospitalization, particularly during the initial stages or for severe symptoms, may be beneficial. Support groups offer a supportive environment for individuals with OCD and their families to share experiences and gain knowledge about the disorder. These comprehensive approaches contribute to effective OCD treatment."

Tourette syndrome is defined by multiple motor and vocal tics lasting for more than one year. Many people have only motor tics or only vocal tics. The first symptoms usually are involuntary movements (tics) of the face, arms, limbs or trunk. These tics are frequent, repetitive and rapid. The most common first symptom is a facial tic (eye blink, nose twitch, grimace), and is replaced or added to by other tics of the neck, trunk, and limbs. These involuntary (outside the patient's control) tics may also be complicated, involving the entire body, such as kicking and stamping. Many person report what are described as premonitory urges -- the urge to perform a motor activity. Other symptoms such as touching, repetitive thoughts and movements and compulsions can occur. There are also verbal tics. These verbal tics (vocalizations) usually occur with the movements; later they may replace one or more motor tics. These vocalizations include grunting, throat clearing, shouting and barking. The verbal tics may also be expressed as coprolalia (the involuntary use of obscene words or socially inappropriate words and phrases) or copropraxia (obscene gestures). Despite widespread publicity, coprolalia/copropraxia is uncommon with tic disorders",

            "Yes, patching the good eye can often help the \"lazy\" eye to improve, but the issue is much broader than that. \"Lazy\" eye is a generic term for a couple of different medical conditions called strabismus and amblyopia. Strabismus is when the eye muscles do not work together perfectly, so one eye points in a different direction than the other, either part-time or full-time. Our brain does NOT like to see two images at once - too confusing to process, so the brain often picks the eye with the better image and \"turns off\" the eye with the poorer image, thereby ignoring the nerve signals from the poorer eye. When the brain learns to ignore the image from one eye, the nerves do not develop properlay and the vision often gets worse in the poorer eye. This is called amblyopia. Amblyopia is a long lasting loss of the quality of vision in one eye, usually resulting from strabismus (above) or anisometropia. Anisometropia is when one eye has a very different prescription than the other, so the brain never gets proper visual signal from the poorer eye. The result of all of these conditions is a \"lazy\" eye, an eye that does not work as well as the other eye. Sadly, the later that the diagnosis of \"lazy\" eye occurs, the harder and less complete is the recovery. If a lazy eye is detected and treated by age 4, most of the visual develop can be rehabilitated, and both eyes will probably see well. If the lazy eye is detected around age 6-7, the worse eye can become better, but will probably never be as good as the better eye. Some doctors think that after age 13-14, almost no improvement will ever come from any treatments, the nerve damage is probably permanant, and little improvement is ever expected. So, it depends on the age of the patient. Search online for other information under: Strabismus Amblyopia Anisometropia Vision therapy Optometrist Good luck!",

The brain tends to ignore the weaker eye's signals, resulting in amblyopia, a lasting loss of vision quality in one eye.

In fact, unprotected (without a condom) anal sex (intercourse) is considered to be very risky behavior. It is possible for either sex partner to become infected with HIV during anal sex. HIV can be found in the blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, or vaginal fluid of a person infected with the virus. In general, the person receiving the semen is at greater risk of getting HIV because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow the virus to enter the body during anal sex. However, a person who inserts his penis into an infected partner also is at risk because HIV can enter through the urethra (the opening at the tip of the penis) or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Not having (abstaining from) sex is the most effective way to avoid HIV. If people choose to have anal sex, they should use a latex condom. Most of the time, condoms work well. However, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky.

Unprotected anal sex is considered highly risky behavior for HIV transmission, as the virus can be present in blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, or vaginal fluid. Both the person receiving and the person inserting are at risk. The thin lining of the rectum may allow the virus to enter, and HIV can also enter through the urethra or small cuts on the penis. While condoms are recommended for anal sex, there is a higher risk of breakage compared to vaginal sex. Abstaining from sex is the most effective way to avoid HIV, and if individuals choose to engage in anal sex, using a latex condom with water-based lubricant is crucial to reduce the risk of transmission."

            "In order to be accepted into any chiropractic college, students must take the same pre-requisites as any future medical student. This includes 1 year of math, english, physics, and 2 years of chemistry (all with accompanying lab classes). Chiropractic students receive a very similar education as medical students, with emphasis on diagnosis of many different medical conditions, lab work (blood or urine analysis), and basic sciences (physiology, pathology, basic anatomy, and neuroanatomy). In addition, chiropractic students receive over 100 hours in palpation and technique courses, much more thoroughly than any Physical therapist or even MD attempting to 'manipulate' the spine. Over 100 hours are also dedicated to learning radiology - how to take x-ray and interpret them - again, much more thoroughly than any medical student (those that are not specializing in radiology, of course). So, yes, chiropractors are real doctors, and can recognize many different medical conditions and refer out appropriately. Several studies have also shown that chiropractors are superior in dealing with musculoskeletal conditions (ie - neck pain and back pain), as well as other complaints than many MDs may ignore or cannot do anything about.",

            "Chiropractic, also known as chiropractic care, is a health care discipline that claims to prevent and treat health problems by using spinal adjustments in order to correct spinal dysfunction, or subluxations. Chiropractic asserts that the brain and nervous system control and coordinate all the body's functions in part through nerve branches that exit from the spinal cord between the vertebrae. Some Chiropractors infer a causal relationship between nerve interference or compression at the spine and subsequent problems in more distant parts or organ systems regulated by the nerve. Practitioners of chiropractic are called chiropractors or chiropractic physicians. In the United States they receive the degree Doctor of Chiropractic, (D.C.) and are referred to as doctor. Chiropractors are licensed in all jurisdictions of the United States of America, in addition to many other countries throughout the world. There is some limited objective clinical data or peer-reviewed research that demonstrates efficacy to certain chiropractic therapies.

        "answers": [
            "Please start by seeing a doctor. If your family has good insurance (or Medicaid -- most states covers kids above the poverty level), I would start with an allergist or a pulmonologist. If yoyou lack insurance, there are often community clinics where yoyou can go for treatment. Asthma is a chronic disease that isn't really cured but can often be very effectively controlled. Poor control causes many issues (and yoyou know that!) and can even be life threatening. How is it managed? The first step is to try and figure out what causes your asthma. This can often be an allergy (although asthma can also be triggered by other things such as cold air and exercise). Regardless of the trigger, a doctor will work with yoyou to reduce that trigger. (In the case of allergies, this can involve everything from covering the mattress if the allergy is to dust to nasal sprays to allergy shots to limiting your exposure to certain things). The doctor may also prescribe a slower acting medicine to help reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. This most often an inhaler but could also be a pill. And this is important: asthma seems to sort of feed on itself and treatment can help reduce the inflamation. Also important is to understand that this will not stop an astma attack that yoyou justt started having -- it takes days to have an impact. In addition, a doctor may presecribe a fast acting inhaler (often called a rescue inhaler). This is designed to be used to treat a current astma attack. So the plan: a) reduce the triggers that cause the asthma; b) longer term medication to help soothe the inflamation and reduce the severity/frequemcy; and c) a rescue inhaler when a and b fail. If yoyou find yourself using the rescue inhaler often, contact your doctor as the first two steps probably need refined. Make sense? Good luck!",

If yoyou don't want to go the prescription route, try using ginger root. It's a natural anti-nausea agent, and will help stop a migraine in its tracks. It wont make one BETTER, but it can stop it from getting worse. The fastest way to administer is to buy ginger root powder (available in grocery stores in the spices aisle), and add a half-teaspoonful to your favorite tea. If it's taste is a little too much for you, yoyou can buy it in pill form at most vitamin/supplement stores. (Also great for helping prevent motionsickness!) Caffeine sometimes works. If the symptoms are particularly bad, I like a cold compress in a pitch dark room in an attempt to sleep it off. If yoyou room isn't dark enough, tape tinfoil on the inside of the windows to block light. If yoyou don't have a cold compress, point a small fan at your face. The best thing yoyou can do about migraines is learn what your triggers are. Sometimes it's food (or food combinations), too much light, too much heat, too much exertion, etc. But involving a doctor is always a good idea.

        "question": "how to beat cancer?",
        "answers": [
            "Treatment of cancer Cancer can be treated by surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy or other methods. The choice of therapy depends upon the location and grade of the tumor and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient (performance status). A number of experimental cancer treatments are also under development. Complete removal of the cancer without damage to the rest of the body is the goal of treatment. Sometimes this can be accomplished by surgery, but the propensity of cancers to invade adjacent tissue or to spread to distant sites by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness. The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by toxicity to other tissues in the body. Radiation can also cause damage to normal tissue. Because \"cancer\" refers to a class of diseases, it is unlikely that there will ever be a single \"cure for cancer\" any more than there will be a single treatment for all infectious diseases. [edit] Surgery If the tumor is localized, surgery is often the preferred treatment. Example procedures include mastectomy for breast cancer and prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The goal of the surgery can be either the removal of only the tumor, or the entire organ. Since a single cancer cell can grow into a sizable tumor, removing only the tumor leads to a greater chance of recurrence. A margin of healthy tissue is often resected to make sure all cancerous tissue is removed. In addition to removal of the primary tumor, surgery is often necessary for staging, e.g. determining the extent of the disease and whether there has been metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Staging determines the prognosis and the need for adjuvant therapy. Occasionally, surgery is necessary to control symptoms, such as spinal cord compression or bowel obstruction. This is referred to as palliative treatment. [edit] Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with drugs (\"anticancer drugs\") that can destroy cancer cells. It interferes with cell division in various possible ways, e.g. with the duplication of DNA or the separation of newly formed chromosomes. Most forms of chemotherapy target all rapidly dividing cells and are not specific for cancer cells. Hence, chemotherapy has the potential to harm healthy tissue, especially those tissues that have a high replacement rate (e.g. intestinal lining). These cells usually repair themselves after chemotherapy. Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are often given at the same time. This is called \"combination chemotherapy\"; most chemotherapy regimens are given in a combination. A novel technique involves taking samples of the patient's tissue before chemotherapy. These tissues samples are screened to ensure they do not contain cancerous cells. The samples are expanded using tissue engineering techniques, and are then re-implanted following high dose chemotherapy in order to recolonise the damaged and somewhat destroyed tissue. A variation upon this method uses allogenic samples (samples donated by a different donor) instead of the patient's own tissue4. [edit] Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is the use of immune mechanisms against tumors. These are used in various forms of cancer, such as breast cancer (trastuzumab/Herceptin\u00ae) but also in leukemia (gemtuzumab ozogamicin/Mylotarg\u00ae). The agents are monoclonal antibodies directed against proteins that are characteristic to the cells of the cancer in question, or cytokines that modulate the immune system's response. [edit] Radiation therapy Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy, X-ray therapy, or irradiation) is the use of ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy can be administered externally via external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or internally via brachytherapy. The effects of radiation therapy are localised and confined to",

        "question": "Which diet is good for ur good health, veg or non-veg?",
        "answers": [
            "In the defense of protein: Veggies increase your gas.[nothing against vegetarians] The basics of most nutrition books Don\u2019t starve yourself. That\u2019s the worst thing yoyou can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since, fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition[not the healthiest though]. The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer. Before I continue let me explain protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Protein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken, fish, sirloin, and milk. Carbohydrates [carbs] can be found almost in anything else even apples. Good carbs: Apples, wheat bread, sourdough bread, grains, and wheat Bad carbs: White bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, Doritos, and sodas! Good fats: Avocados, pecans, almonds, and peanut butter The ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like [50%Protien:40%Carbs:10%fat] This can sound meaningless. So in plain terms consume only good fats [portioned] and yoyou should be okay. Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately. not consecutively]. The reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because yoyou are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories] so theoretically if yoyou eat less fats and more proteins yoyou will have a less appetite because yoyou will eat more. Another nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself. That\u2019s how the Adkins basically works. If yoyou consume more proteins and less carbs yoyou will lose weight. I leave to yoyou to decide if this is good you. I would also advice yoyou to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because yoyou are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that yoyou will eat in 3 hour and yoyou will quickly noticed that yoyou will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry] if yoyou do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla. Yoyou are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if yoyou have been starving yourself or if yoyou don\u2019t exercise].",

        ],
        "labelled_summary": "In defense of protein, the argument is presented that while vegetables may have nutritional benefits, they can also lead to increased gas. The basics of weight loss emphasize not starving oneself, as it can slow down metabolism and result in the body storing more fat. Protein, derived from animal sources like chicken, fish, and milk, is contrasted with carbohydrates found in various foods, including apples. The advice is to focus on good carbs like whole grains and avoid bad carbs found in items like white bread and sodas. Good fats, such as avocados and nuts, are encouraged in moderation. A suggested diet ratio is around 50% protein, 40% carbs, and 10% fat. Consuming good fats in controlled portions can help reduce appetite, as the body requires around 1200 calories for a 180lb person. Emphasizing the conversion of carbohydrates into fat, the recommendation is to consume more proteins and fewer carbs for weight loss, aligning with principles similar to the Atkins diet. The significance of including both vegetables and protein in controlled amounts is emphasized for overall health, with an intriguing note about potential benefits for sexual health."

            "It depends on the form of the calcium - it is bound to other elements, some of which are easier to absorb than others. It also requires Vitamin D to be aborbed and used. Calcium and all the minerals also need a fairly acidic stomach to be absorbed. So if you're stomach acidity is low, or yoyou have it with a big meal (which uses up the hydrochloric acid that makes your stomach acid) yoyou may not absorb so much. Women need about 2-3 gm (2,000 - 3,000 mg) of calcium. I don't think the value is too high in total, but the form in which it's present may or may not be readily aborbed. I would guess that Total also have vitamin D. Your body is seldom able to absorb all of the vitamins or minerals yoyou eat at once. A lot of it is lost, but the actual amount yoyou need to be absorbed is less than the required daily intake. So, the RDA of 2,000 mg for a mineral is based on the expectation that yoyou will only aborb say 20% of it, so your body's actual need would be 400 mg. The best source for minerals in the most bioavailable form is broth - from beef, chicken, pork bones."

The form of calcium in foods, such as Total cereal, may affect absorption. The body doesn't absorb all consumed vitamins and minerals at once, but the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 2,000 mg factors in lower absorption rates, suggesting that the actual needed absorption may be less than the daily intake recommendations."

            "no",
            "Ichthyosis, literally \"fish like\", is a group of skin disorders that cause a person's skin to have a dry, thickened scaly character. Often inherited from parental genes, this group of disorders is believed to be a result of an over-production of keratin, an important component to the outer layer of skin, nails and hair. The most common inherited forms of Ichthyosis include Ichthyosis vulgaris, Lammelar ichthyosis, and X-linked ichthyosis. Acquired ichtyosis is associated with other systemic diseases, such as hypothyroidism, hepatitis, HIV infection, and some forms of cancer like Hodgkin's lymphoma or leukemia. The term 'ichthyosis' is also sometimes used to describe milder dry skin disorders such as Xeroderma, which is neither inherited nor acquired and can result from something as simple as bathing too much. Diagnosis and treatment for ichthyosis is broad, since there are a variety of potential causes for ichthyosis. Because of the largely genetic pathology of ichthyosis, there are only treatments that reduce symptoms and the pain and discomfort associated with scaled skin. More severe forms of ichthyosis are treated with medications that block keratin formation, such as retinoids and imidazole derivatives."

To answer your question, outside of religious groups, jack ing off is perfectly normal. It is absoultely not harmful and actually healthy in many circumstances. There are two ways in which jack ing becomes unhealthy. One way is if yoyou come to depend on it and it gets in the way of establishing real relationships later in life, but this is very rare. The second way it is unhealthy is that sometimes using porn o graphy (spaces were intentional to avoid Yahoo's cencorship) repeatedly can lead to an objectification of the opposite sex.

            "Cold turkey. It works, but only if yoyou are 100% resolved in your mind. Yoyou must be of the mind that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Yoyou must focus your EMOTIONAL energy; be angry with the addiction. Be mad that yoyou could be twisted and manipulated into this addiction to nicotine. Remember the wet ragged cough, the trips to the store to buy cigs at inconvenient times, in bad weather, when yoyou are low on money, etc. Remember how yoyou stink after smoking; how its smell sticks to your clothes, your car, home, etc. Think about all those megatives and realize that for every cig that yoyou enjoy, several others are not enjoyed but are consumed to satisfy your body's addiction. Cigarettes are physically addictive, comparable to cocaine or alcohol. Nicotine is a powerful substance. Do it! Don't look back- it's a good move!",
            "I quit 8 years ago and it was the BEST thing I have ever done for myself! I used the Nicoderm patch. If yoyou decide to try it, I won't candy-coat this method and tell yoyou \"its a breeze\"; its not. But as a heavy-heavy smoker of 20 years, I will tell yoyou truthfully that quitting smoking takes, first and foremost, WILLPOWER. Even though the nicotine in your system makes it a \"physical\" addiction, it is also a \"mental\" addiction as well. Yoyou mentally have to stop associating smoking with things that are pleasurable; for me, it was smoking while doing artwork, smoking while out in clubs and having a drink (but smoking in clubs is getting more and more rare). Yoyou will be cranky for about 2 weeks while on the patch and yoyou should try and stay away from other people that smoke; just the smell of a cigarette being lit or even the SOUND of a Bic lighter being lit, was enough to make me want a cigarette! Keep your hands busy, don't sit around because yoyou will think about it. Your teeth will look better and as a BIG incentive, your hair and your clothes will not reek of yesterday's smoke. Yoyou will also not have to clean all that yellow-ish nicotine stain off your walls! I would highly reocmmend the patch; cold turkey is so awful, the withdrawal without any help is just terrible and so unnecessary. YOU CAN DO IT! Good luck in whatever method yoyou chose!",
            "Cold Turkey",
            "I have used the gum, the patch and have quit cold turkey. Cold turkey worked best for me. I went and got a box of bic pens (just the plan ones with the soft plastic white barrels) and removed the ink and used those when I got a bad craving. Just having something in my hand that was about the same diameter as a cigarette seemed to help me. I also chewed them, A LOT! Just make sure to remove the ink if yoyou are going to chew on them. I quit a while back and have been doing great ever since and I live with a smoker. That is the hardest thing to do when yoyou are trying to quit! Yoyou might also check to see if yoyou state (or local) health services agency offers any smoking cessation programs. Often times, they will no only offer counsling but also patches or gum or other aids of your choice. Good Luck",

            "Avian flyou is a serious virus that can be dangerous to the elderly, the young, and anyone with compromised immune systems. While it is mostly still contained to birds, it is spreading rapidly and there have been reports of it spreading to humans. Excerpts from the CDC: Bird flyou is an infection caused by avian (bird) influenza (flu) viruses. These flyou viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines, but usually do not get sick from them. However, bird flyou is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys, very sick and kill them. Bird flyou viruses do not usually infect humans, but several cases of human infection with bird flyou viruses have occurred since 1997. The current outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N1) among poultry in Asia and Europe (see below) is an example of a bird flyou outbreak that has caused human infections and deaths. In such situations, people should avoid contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces, and should be careful when handling and cooking poultry. For more information about avian influenza and food safety issues, visit the the World Health Organization website Symptoms of bird flyou in humans have ranged from typical flu-like symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress), and other severe and life-threatening complications. The symptoms of bird flyou may depend on which virus caused the infection.",

These pandemics killed scores of people. The panic also stems from the fact that there is no vaccine for H5N1 virus, the bird flyou that is currently affecting Asia. Like last year, vaccines for \"regular\" human flyou are in short supply as well. Under normal circumstances, when the flyou hits yoyou re just feverish, achey and fatigued for a few days. When the flyou strikes more vulnerable people, like the elderly and very young babies, it can cause respiratory problems and even kill them.",

Historical pandemics, like those in 1957 and 1968, resulted from bird flyou mutating with human viruses. The absence of a vaccine for H5N1 and limited availability of regular flyou vaccines contribute to concerns.

A negative effect was not observed among subjects who had previously been heavy users but were no longer using the substance. We conclude that marijuana does not have a long-term negative impact on global intelligence.\u201d This study compared IQ scores of individuals aged 9-12 years before they started using cannabis, with their scores at 17-20 years. Light users, former users and non-users showed a gain in IQ over the same period. One reason for the decreased IQ and memory in consistent heavy users could be the fact that long-term cannabis use has been found to decrease blood flow to the front areas of the brain (Neurotoxicology and Teratology 2001 Sep-Oct; vol 23 pp. 437-43 Frontal lobe dysfunction in long-term cannabis users by Lundqvist T, Jonsson S, Warkentin S. of the Division of Medical Neurochemistry, Lund University Hospital, 221 85, Lund, Sweden http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11711246&dopt=Abstract A study published in Public Health and Nutrition, June 2001, vol. 4 pp. 781-786 (Dietary intake and nutritional status of US adult marijuana users: results from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Marijuana users also consumed more sodium, fewer fruits, and more pork, cheese, and salty snacks.\u201d Carotenoids are important anti-oxidants which help to prevent cancer and other diseases. An increased risk of these diseases might be due not so much to marijuana use itself as to the lifestyle led by many who use it.

        "answers": [
            "The coronary arteries surround the heart to supply the heart muscle with the fresh blood nourishment it needs to do its work of pumping blood throughout the rest of the body. Just like other organs, the heart needs a constant supply of oxygenated blood to feed itself. Coronary Artery Disease is an occlusion (obstruction) of the coronary (heart) arteries resulting from atherosclerosis (arteriosclerosis). When the body goes into more strenuous activity, the heart has to work harder to supply the body's demands for fresh, oxygen-rich blood. An ischemic heart reacts by giving off a sensation of pain. We call this pain angina, or, more technically, angina pectoris. When the blockage of an artery is complete, for example, when an occluded artery is blocked by a thrombus (blood clot), the result is a heart attack. The heart tissue supplied by that coronary artery begins to die, and some of the heart muscle may be permanently damaged, or, in very severe cases, may result in death of the patient. On a personal note - My father had a triple heart by-pass last year as he had 3 blocked ones, he has been told that he can and should now lead a normal life and that his heart will not be the reason he dies as its beating now as though he was 20 years younger.",

            "Since yoyou asked this question in \"Heart Disease\" I'm assuming yoyou are talking about a coronary (heart) artery and that this is a recent occurence. The heart has two main arteries, the left coronary artery and the right coronary artery. In general, the left coronary artery supplies the largest amount of heart tissue. Unless the person yoyou are talking about has a bypass graft to the left coronary system (this would have been a major open heart surgery in the past) a completely occluded left coronary artery is extremely serious (immediately life threatening) I'm assuming the patient is hospitalized at this point."

        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, the coronary arteries play a vital role in supplying the heart muscle with oxygenated blood to facilitate its pumping function and nourish itself. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) arises from the obstruction of these arteries due to atherosclerosis. During strenuous activity, the heart works harder to meet the body's demand for fresh, oxygen-rich blood, leading to angina or angina pectoris\u2014a sensation of pain. When an artery is completely blocked, such as by a blood clot (thrombus), it can result in a heart attack. This causes the heart tissue supplied by the affected coronary artery to undergo damage, and in severe cases, it may lead to the patient's death. The severity of a completely occluded left coronary artery, which typically supplies a significant portion of the heart, is considered extremely serious and immediately life-threatening, requiring urgent medical attention, possibly hospitalization, especially if recent and not addressed through interventions like bypass grafting."

That\u2019s the worst thing yoyou can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since, fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition[not the healthiest though]. The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer. Before I continue let me explain protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Protein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken, fish, sirloin, and milk. Carbohydrates [carbs] can be found almost in anything else even apples. Good carbs: Apples, wheat bread, sourdough bread, grains, and wheat Bad carbs: White bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, Doritos, and sodas! Good fats: Avocados, pecans, almonds, and peanut butter The ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like [50%Protien:40%Carbs:10%fat] This can sound meaningless. So in plain terms consume only good fats [portioned] and yoyou should be okay. Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately. not consecutively]. The reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because yoyou are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories] so theoretically if yoyou eat less fats and more proteins yoyou will have a less appetite because yoyou will eat more. Another nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself. That\u2019s how the Adkins basically works. If yoyou consume more proteins and less carbs yoyou will lose weight. I leave to yoyou to decide if this is good you. I would also advice yoyou to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because yoyou are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that yoyou will eat in 3 hour and yoyou will quickly noticed that yoyou will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry] if yoyou do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla. Yoyou are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if yoyou have been starving yourself or if yoyou don\u2019t exercise].",

Anytime yoyou have heat in your home, it's going to deprive the air of moisture. A humidifer helps to put that back in so that your skin isn't as parched, and yoyou don't wake up feeling really thirsty and dried out. But if your skin is peely and flaky, then you'll need to supplement the effects of a humidifier with a good moisturizer.

While a humidifier won't directly moisturize your skin, it contributes to preventing excessive dryness. In cases of peeling and flaky skin, it's recommended to complement the humidifier's effects with a good moisturizer. During the winter, the combination of dry, cold outdoor air and indoor heating can be harsh on the skin. Staying well-hydrated is also crucial for managing dry skin.

These drugs are often combined with other drugs for best results. Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), such as efavirenz, nevirapine, or delavirdine. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as tenofovir. Protease inhibitors (PIs), such as atazanavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, fosamprenavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir.

The common cold (also known as \"acute nasopharyngitis\") is a mild viral infectious disease of the nose and throat; the upper respiratory system. Symptoms include sneezing, sniffling, running/blocked nose (often these occur simultaneously, or one in each nostril); scratchy, sore, or phlegmy throat; coughing; headache; and tiredness. Colds typically last three to five days, with residual coughing lasting up to three weeks. An allergy or Type I hypersensitivity is an immune malfunction whereby a person's body is hypersensitised to react immunologically to typically nonimmunogenic substances. When a person is hypersensitised, these substances are known as allergens. The word allergy derives from the Greek words allos meaning \"other\" and ergon meaning \"reaction\" or \"reactivity\". Type I hypersensitivity is characterised by excessive activation of mast cells by immunoglobulin E resulting in a systemic inflammatory response that can result in symptoms as benign as a runny nose, to life-threatening anaphylactic shock and death.",

The virus causes an immune reaction which is what makes yoyou feel those symptoms, i.e. a fever, stuffy nose, etc. An allergy is produced by the body. It is essentially the body's immune system over-reacting to what is an innocuos substance- i.e. peanut butter, shell fish, or pollen from plants."

With pegylated interferon therapy and Ribavirin treatment, many people can ERADICATE the virus, meaning the HCV RNA viral load is not detectable with the most sensitive assay. Some hepatologists consider this a \"cure\" while others are hesitant to use that word. Once treatment is completed, yoyou typically have an HCV viral load test 6 months after completing therapy. If there is no detectable virus, then yoyou have achieved a sustained viral response or SVR. This is very indicative of long term clearance of the virus. HCV antibodies can still be detectable, even after the virus has been cleared. A standard HCV antibody screening test would still be positive and life insurance companies may still consider yoyou infected as a result of positive antibody tests. However, the long term risk of fibrosis and cirrhosis are dramatically reduced if not eliminated. There are reports of sexual transmission of HCV, but it is a very low liklihood. In fact, the CDC does not make any specific recommendations regarding safe sex between partners with different HCV status. From CDC website: \"If yoyou have one long-term, steady sex partner, there is a very low chance of giving HCV to that partner and yoyou do not need to change your sexual practices. If yoyou want to lower the small chance of spreading HCV to your sex partner, yoyou may decide to use latex condoms. (The efficacy of latex condoms in preventing infection with HCV is unknown, but their proper use may reduce transmission.) Ask your doctor about having your sex partner tested.\"",
            "first of all HCV is cured now in over 50% of cases by modern therapy. Some of your readers obviously are not very educated. Secondly, HCV is probably never transmitted by kissing and rarely if ever transmitted sexually. Indeed, if yoyou check the CDC (center for disease control) website it recommends no special precautions for sexual contact amongst monogamous couples even if HCV test is positive. I feel that HCV probably is transmitted RARELY via sexual transmission, but on the order of 1% of the time. Hep B on the other hand is commonly transmitted sexually.

Granted a large open wound in the mouth will make it much easier for any bacteria or virus to get in - but it doesn't have to be something large or even noticeable. Can yoyou assess your own oral health? Most of us cannot. Brushing and flossing teeth leaves tiny cuts and abrasions on the gums and inside of the cheek. Eating things like potato chips, popcorn, hard candies, very hot foods, etc. can also cause abrasions and cuts. All of these things can make it easier to get HIV. The only way to be 100% safe is for your male partner to wear a condom. If you're going down on a woman use a dental damn or some other latex barrier & make sure she's not menstruating.

Oseltamivir blocks the action of neuraminidase (it is a neuraminidase inhibitor) thereby reducing the spread of influenza. By preventing the spread of virus from cell to cell, the symptoms and duration of influenza infection are reduced. On average, oseltamivir reduces the duration of symptoms by one and a half days if treatment is started within forty-eight hours after symptoms begin. Generic Available: No Prescription: Yes Preparations: 75 mg tablets Storage: Store at room temperature, 15-30\u00b0C (59-86\u00b0F) Prescribed For: Oseltamivir is used for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza infection in adults who have had symptoms for no longer than two days. Dosing: Oseltamivir is administered orally. The recommended dose is one tablet twice daily for five days. For the best results, treatment should begin as soon as symptoms develop. Drug Interactions: There are no known interactions between oseltamivir and other drugs. Oseltamivir does not interact with the flyou vaccine. Therefore, vaccinated individuals can use oseltamivir and vice versa.. Pregnancy: Oseltamivir has not been adequately evaluated in pregnant women. Nursing Mothers: The use of oseltamivir in nursing mothers has not been evaluated. Side Effects: The most frequent side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bronchitis, abdominal pain, headache and dizziness. Administering oseltamivir after meals helps reduce nausea.

Oseltamivir is prescribed for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza infection in adults, with a recommended oral dosage of one tablet twice daily for five days. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bronchitis, abdominal pain, headache, and dizziness, which can be alleviated by taking the medication after meals.

Flossing removes accumulated bacteria, plaque and food that may be trapped between teeth. Mouth rinses are effective in temporary relief of bad breath. Consult your dentist and/or physician if the condition persists. It is important to practice good oral hygiene, such as brushing and flossing your teeth at least twice a day. To alleviate the odor, clean your tongue with your toothbrush or a tongue scraper, a plastic tool that scrapes away bacteria that builds on the tongue. Chewing sugar-free gum also may help control the odor. If yoyou have dentures or a removable appliance, such as a retainer or mouthguard, clean the appliance thoroughly before placing it back in your mouth. Before yoyou use mouth rinses, deodorizing sprays or tablets, talk with your dentist because these products only mask the odor temporarily, and some products work better than others.",

They have to utilize the available Sunlight to the maximum level.",
            "Because, as yoyou grow older, the number of melanocytes (color pigments in the skin) gets smaller and smaller. So the hairs have less pigment in them. The less pigment they have, the whiter they become. And the number of melanocytes is hereditary, so if one of your parents turned grey at a young age, there is a good chance yoyou will too, but not necessarily, as genetics is tricky."

The phenomenon is linked to the need for more sunlight among older individuals to produce Vitamin D. Skin also undergoes changes with age, and in colder regions, lighter skin tones can be attributed to maximizing sunlight absorption for Vitamin D production. As people age, the number of melanocytes decreases, leading to less pigment in the hair and a whitening effect. This reduction in melanocytes is hereditary, meaning that if a parent turned gray early, there is a likelihood of a similar occurrence in the offspring, though genetics can be unpredictable."

            "Lysine is one of numerous amino acids that the body needs for growth and tissue repair. It is classified as one of the nine \"essential\" amino acids because yoyou need to get it from outside sources such as foods or supplements--in other words the body can't make it on its own. Researchers are exploring the value of lysine supplementation and the consumption of lysine-rich foods for lowering cholesterol, improving athletic performance, and enhancing recovery after surgery. Some nutritionally oriented physicians and dentists recommend taking lysine during an outbreak of canker sores to speed healing. The exact cause of these tiny but quite painful mouth ulcers is unclear, but most research indicates that a virus is responsible. However, there have been almost no clinical trials using lysine as a remedy for canker sores. The most promising application of lysine is its use in managing and preventing painful and unsightly herpes sores caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Specifically, lysine may help to: # Prevent and relieve cold sores (herpes). Exciting research over the past several decades suggests that lysine may be helpful in controlling herpes simplex-related infections. There are two types of this virus: type 1, which typically causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth, and type 2, which tends to cause genital sores. However, both forms can cause eruptions around the mouth or on the genitals. Once infected with the virus, yoyou have it permanently. It may lie dormant, but it doesn't go away. Outbreaks are usually painful and unsightly, as well as contagious. A few years ago, researchers discovered that in order to grow (replicate), the herpes virus needs arginine, another common amino acid. (Foods high in arginine include chocolate, peanuts, almonds, seeds, cereal grains, gelatin, and raisins.) Lysine competes with arginine for absorption and entry into tissue cells. And when lysine is present, it inhibits the growth of HSV by knocking out arginine. This makes a diet high in lysine and low in arginine a useful tool in managing HSV infections. In a recent study, participants consumed large amounts of lysine (about 1 gram three times each day) while restricting food sources of arginine. A significant number of participants (74%) noticed an improvement in their HSV infections and a decrease in the number of outbreaks. -As a side note, broccoli is also one of the better vegetable to help your body in keeping outbreaks at bay.",

Laparoscopy is a procedure where your doctor will insert a small scope into your abdomen and visualise your reproductive tract. Hysteroscopy literally means she will put a scope in your uterus and look for scarring, and perhaps inject a dye and take x-rays.

Removal methods include natural elimination, chemical dissolution, surgery, and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. While some home remedies suggest using vinegar (acetic acid), it's crucial to approach such remedies with caution, as ingesting strong acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) is not only ineffective for eliminating kidney stones but also poses significant risks to kidney health. It's essential to rely on scientifically proven medical treatments and consult a healthcare professional for appropriate advice on managing kidney stones."

            "\"Ultram\" is just one of the brand names for the drug Tramadol. Regarding dependence/addiction: Some controversy exists regarding the dependence liability of tramadol. Gr\u00fcnenthal has promoted it as an opioid with \"little\" risk of dependence, claiming little evidence of such dependence in their clinical trials. They offer the theory that since the M1 metabolite is the principal agonist at \u03bc-opioid receptors, the delayed agonist activity reduces dependence liability. Despite these claims it is apparent, in community practice, that dependence does occur to this agent. This would be expected since analgesic and dependence effects are mediated by the same \u03bc-opioid receptor. However, this dependence liability is considered relatively low by health authorities, such that tramadol is classified as a Schedule 4 [Prescription Only Medicine] in Australia, rather than as a Schedule 8 [Controlled Drug] like other opioids (Rossi, 2004). Here are some of the effects yoyou may experience: POSITIVE * Pain relief * Sense of well-being (6-8 hours) * Positive outlook NEUTRAL * Itching (increases with dosage) * Stimulation (physical and mental) * Sweating * Agitation * Tremor NEGATIVE * Tolerance (requiring more of the drug to achieve the desired pain relief) * Nausea or vomiting (some people find alleviation by eating before ingesting) * Constipation or diarrhea (including upon abrupt cessation of use) * Difficulty urinating or increased urination * Dizziness, vertigo, reduced coordination, dis-equilibrium * Headache * Weakness * Anxiety * Heartburn * Tiredness, \"nodding\", respiratory depression at high dose"

Not only that, some remedies sold over the internet can even cure yoyou with high survival rates. Please read this. I have written it for several yahooers battling cancer, but yoyou should read it if yoyou need. Here goes: (To be honest, chemotherapy is not a cancer treatment. Here is the situation. Chemo can take care of the problem right away, but the doctor always says that, some can live an extended 2 years, or 3 years. And some die right away from the chemicals. This is with late stages of cancer. Now, for early stages, it helps the problem but your health is deteriorated. They say that chemo affects the cancer and your normal body cells. How many people yoyou know, who have had late stages of cancer, and lived through it pass 5 yours with chemo therapy? I bet yoyou that yoyou have never even heard of it. Even if someone has, how many people is that compared to that masses? The problem with other medicines is that the pharmaceautical companies cannot control that product. What if it was tree bark say for instance. How many people do yoyou know will buy the pills if they can just walk up to any tree and bite a piece off to save themselves? See? So, USA doctors are familiar with these remedies, but they do not talk about it. Try asking your doctor about green algae, or cesium chloride, or paw paw, etc etc. Then they start to talk. Otherwise, they wont say a word. And if yoyou dont know, how can yoyou ask? So, the doctors lips are sealed tight. The individual doctors on the other hand are sometimes scared to talk about it. It is because, if they open their mouths, they would be facing the whole medical community. Alot of them go into the medical field to help people, and some go in it for money. But, the top ranking ones in control are all in it for money. If not, they would have never gotten their position. I do not suggest yoyou go with chemo therapy. Yoyou can look up some alternative medicine to cancer and they are all over the place on the net. The best ranked one is cesium chloride, paw paw, and along with others. Some health websites even have a place where yoyou can go and tell them your stage of cancer and which type of cancer, and they will sell yoyou a package based on your individual problem. There are also some doctors scattered all over the USA who specialize in cancer. Yoyou never hear about them right? Well, they wont be bothered by the medical community if they do a small operation without much advertising. But, they all report about 90% survival rates on cancers that regular cancer doctors give up on. And if that doctor didnt give up, do yoyou expect to live anyways? No. I speak out to yoyou because I dont want yoyou to die like the two of my friends who have already died. Certain doctors even said that they could cure it with 80% survival rate. But, I didnt have the money to help them. So, I am speaking out in hopes that nothing happens to yoyou and yoyou survive. Regardless of your stage of cancer. Cesium chloride is what works best. Look it up, its everywhere. Even oxygen drops help. Yoyou can use them both at the same time. The thing is with these alternatives is that, some of them make yoyou feel extremely bad at the beginning, but after a while yoyou get used to it, and then yoyou are gone with the cancer before yoyou know it. So dont feel discouraged. Oxygen drops keep cancer from growing because your body can live with more oxygen. As a matter of fact, it helps circulate your blood. Cancer cannot live at the sight of oxygen. It has been said that not enough oxygen is what causes cancer. I dont know what the cause is, because there are many causes.

            "Black or dark circles under or around the eyes can be caused by many different factors. The following are the most common causes of those unattractive dark circles. HEREDITY Like varicose veins, dark circles under the eyes are usually an inherited trait. If yoyou have dark circles, there is a good chance that others in your family also have them. The skin under the eye is very thin. When blood passes through the large veins close to the surface of the skin it can produce a bluish tint. The more transparent your skin, also an inherited trait, the darker the circles appear. EXPOSURE TO THE SUN Even in darker skinned people, exposure to sunlight, especially during the summer months, can cause a higher-than-normal level of skin pigmentation (melanin) under the eyes. People get sun tans because exposure to the sun increases the natural pigmentation of the skin and draws that pigmentation to the surface. The same principle applies to the skin under the eyes. ALLERGIES, ASTHMA and ECZEMA Any condition that yoyou have that causes your eyes to itch can contribute to darker circles under the eyes because rubbing or scratching the skin can darken the skin. Hay fever sufferers particularly will notice under-eye \"smudges\" during the height of the allergy season. Some food allergies can also cause the area under the eyes to appear darker. MEDICATIONS Any medications that yoyou are taking that causes blood vessels to dilate, can cause circles under the eyes to darken. Because the skin under the eyes is very delicate, any increase blood flow shows through the skin. NUTRITION The lack of nutrients in the diet, or the lack of a balance diet, can contribute to the discoloration of the area under the eyes. FATIGUE, LACK OF SLEEP A lack of sleep or excessive tiredness can cause paleness of the skin, which again allows the blood underneath the skin to become more visible and appear more blue or darker. PREGNANCY and MENSTRUATION The skin can also become more pale during pregnancy and menstruation, which again allows the underlying veins under the eyes to become more visible. AGE If yoyou have a propensity to have dark circles under yoyou eyes, as yoyou grow older, they are likely to become more noticeable and permanent. Excess folds of skin under the eyes will also make dark circles more pronounced.",

        "answers": [
            "How common is vasectomy? Vasectomy is used as a means of contraception in many parts of the world. A total of about 50 million men have had a vasectomy--a number that corresponds to roughly 5 percent of all married couples of reproductive age. In comparison, about 15 percent of couples rely on female sterilization for birth control. Approximately half a million vasectomies are performed in the United States each year. About one out of six men over age 35 has been vasectomized. The prevalence of men undergoing the procedure increases with higher levels of education and income. Among married couples in the United States, only female sterilization and oral contraception are relied upon more often for family planning. How is vasectomy done? In the conventional approach, a physician makes one or two small incisions, or cuts, in the skin of the scrotum, which has been numbed with a local anesthetic. The vas is cut, and a small piece may be removed. Next, the doctor ties the cut ends and sews up the scrotal incision. The entire procedure is then repeated on the other side.

Vasectomy is a popular method of birth control: in 1983, figures showed that approximately 10 million men had been sterilized in the U.S. since 1969. Excision of the vas deferens is a minor surgical procedure that can be performed in a physician's office in less than half an hour. A small incision is made on one side of the scrotum (the external sac housing the testes) and the vas deferens is located, cut, and the ends tied off. The incision is closed and the procedure is repeated on the other side. After surgery, it is necessary to wait until a negative sperm count is obtained before discarding other means of contraception, because viable sperm cells are retained in the seminal vesicles (the pair of storage pouches where sperm is mixed with other components of semen) and along the various sperm ducts. In addition it is usually advised that the patient be reexamined after a year, because the severed ends of the vas deferens occasionally reknit. Sterility resulting from vasectomy is considered to be permanent, and attempts at surgically reversing vasectomy, called vasovasotomy, have had limited success. In India, where the government is trying to stem the tide of overpopulation, money is paid to men who submit to voluntary vasectomy. Efforts to overcome the irreversibility of vasectomy have also led to experimentation with the implantation of faucetlike devices that can be made to open or close the sperm duct in a simple operation. Such devices have functioned successfully in animals but are still considered experimental in humans because of their unproved reversibility, high cost, and the degree of surgical skill needed to implant them. Another option suggested to those undergoing vasectomy is to preserve their fertility by depositing semen in sperm banks. Such semen samples are frozen in liquid nitrogen below \u2212300\u00b0F (\u2212185\u00b0F) and are considered to be viable for an indefinite period.

Psychiatry defines these traits as a \"mental illness\", and promotes it as a \"disease\" that requires \"treatment\". It is not a \"disease\", despite claims made in certain peoples answers here. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes \"schizophrenia\" as a biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or \"chemical imbalance\". \"For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign.\" Fred A. Baughman Jr., MD (Neurologist, Pediatric Neurology), & Fellow at the American Academy of Neurology. \"Chemical imbalance\u2026it\u2019s a shorthand term really, it\u2019s probably drug industry derived\u2026 We don\u2019t have tests because to do it, you\u2019d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea.\" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005. Symptoms that psychiatry labels as \"schizophrenia\" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people have overcome disorders such as \"bipolar\" and \"schizophrenia\" through effective megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including \"schizophrenia\". [1,2,3,4,5,6] Yoyou may also be interested to know that the work undertaken by pioneers such as Dr. Lars Martensson and the late Dr. Loren Mosher show that there is also another way - far safer and more effective than psychiatric restraint, drugs and electro-shocks. For over a decade Loren R Mosher, MD, held a central position in American psychiatric research. He was the first Chief of the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia at the National Institute of Mental Health, 1969-1980. He founded the Schizophrenia Bulletin and for ten years he was its Editor-in-Chief. He also led the Soteria Project, which demonstrated that effective rehabilitation is possible without harmful antipsychotic drugs. Soteria provided a safe and sane environment where schizophrenic patients could stay, medication-free, with a young, nonprofessional staff trained to listen to and understand them and provide companionship. The idea was that schizophrenia can often be overcome with the help of meaningful relationships, rather than with drugs, and that such treatment would eventually lead to unquestionably healthier lives. The results were fantastic. Over just 6 weeks, patients recovered as quickly as those treated with medication in hospitals. [7,8] Bottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a \"faith\", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called \"research\" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.

            "The basics of most nutrition books Don\u2019t starve yourself. That\u2019s the worst thing yoyou can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since, fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition[not the healthiest though]. The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer. Before I continue let me explain protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Protein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken, fish, sirloin, and milk. Carbohydrates [carbs] can be found almost in anything else even apples. Good carbs: Apples, wheat bread, sourdough bread, grains, and wheat Bad carbs: White bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, Doritos, and sodas! Good fats: Avocados, pecans, almonds, and peanut butter The ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like [50%Protien:40%Carbs:10%fat] This can sound meaningless. So in plain terms consume only good fats [portioned] and yoyou should be okay. Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately. not consecutively]. The reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because yoyou are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories] so theoretically if yoyou eat less fats and more proteins yoyou will have a less appetite because yoyou will eat more. Another nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself. That\u2019s how the Adkins basically works. If yoyou consume more proteins and less carbs yoyou will lose weight. I leave to yoyou to decide if this is good you. I would also advice yoyou to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because yoyou are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that yoyou will eat in 3 hour and yoyou will quickly noticed that yoyou will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry] if yoyou do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla. Yoyou are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if yoyou have been starving yourself or if yoyou don\u2019t exercise].",

Sometimes yoyou need to do more to get the help yoyou need than just do online research. The best advice that I have is to talk to your doctor to work up an individualized treatment plan for your diabetes. Not everyone's diabetes works the same do the uniqueness of the human body and differences from person to person. Also, seek out your local public health resources for valuable (and usually free of charge) education relating to diabetes. Your local health department would be a great place to start your search for resources. Some basic diabetes pointers: -- Eat a healthy diet. Reduce your sugar intake to minimal (not nonexistent though -- yoyou have to have some sugar to have energy), low fat, low carb, etc. Also, pay special attention to your portion sizes at meals. Even eating too much of some health-conscious foods can be harmful to your blood sugar levels. Consider talking to a dietician. -- Take your medications regularly. Try to take them around the same time every day to maintain constant, consistent levels in your system. Only take the dosage prescribed. Don't alter your dose to self-treat high / low sugar levels. -- Monitor your blood sugars at home on a daily basis. (I usually monitor first thing in the morning and 2 hours after each meal, but talk to your doctor and see what he / she wants yoyou to do as far as a monitoring schedule goes.) -- Exercise. Getting out and moving around, walking, running, etc. are all great for helping keep a check on your blood sugar levels. Some resources do say, however, that if yoyou do a self-check on your sugar and get a level of 300 or more, DO NOT exercise. Talk to yoyou doctor and get his / her recommendation for your exercise plan. It basically all comes down to yoyou as to how well yoyou manage your diabetes. While it is a terrible condition (I know, I have it too...), yoyou can live a long and healthy life with proper measures of control. Work with your doctor and come up with a treatment plan.

Moderately increase your cardio and decrease the intensity and length of your weightlifting in a two week long \"cutting phase,\" during which yoyou should eat a few hundred fewer calories than normal (every 2-4 weeks). For me, a lot of intense cardio helped, although I was already USED to intense cardio. Yoyou shouldn't overdo your cardio, since it decreases growth hormone(IGF-1).

In fact, some mild cases may go unnoticed for a long time. Numbness, pain, or tingling in the feet, or legs may, after several years, lead to weakness in the muscles of the feet. Occasionally, diabetic neuropathy can flare up suddenly and affect specific nerves so that an affected individual will develop double vision or drooping eyelids, or weakness and atrophy of the thigh muscles. Nerve damage caused by diabetes generally occurs over a period of years and may lead to problems with the digestive tract and sexual organs, which can cause indigestion, diarrhea or constipation, dizziness, bladder infections, and impotence. The loss of sensation in the feet may increase the possibility for foot injuries to go unnoticed and develop into ulcers or lesions that become infected.",

For instance I soon had a migraine after consuming chocolate, cashews and food containing M.S.G. So I avoided those things but the migraines persisted. I tried making sure I went to the chiropractor which helped some but not as effectively as I wanted. After the last occurrence, I finally sought out my doctor and had a very frank chat. After she asked many questions we realized that the migraines were more frequent through the last few years and may be due to hormonal changes. So she prescribe a medication that I take one time before bed. I'm to keep a journal of any headaches but especially migraines to see if the medicine works in helping to prevent or decrease their occurrence. She also prescribed a medicine to take when the onset of a migraine occurs. This one is supposed to stop it in it's tracks. She also prescribed a pain medication to help if none of the other two work! I think if yoyou haven't already done so, talk with your doctor. Or seek out a chiropractor, naturopath, massage therapist and even try a new mattress since poor sleep can be a trigger. I hope this helps. Take care and best of luck.",

I hope yoyou feel better soon.",
            "Hi, I am subject to migraines too. I was subject to strong ones like yours, making me sick and miserable for the day. Sometimes miserable for a week period with a migaine every day. I tried many medications, aspirin, advil , coffee, etc... and some other prescription stuff that just knocked me down for a while. Nothing really successful indeed for pain relief. Even if these medications were meant to help, in fact it did poorly its job on me painwise. Until one day, when my cousin tried accupressure points in the back of my head while having a migraine. I was greatly releived after 20 seconds of massaging these accupressure(accupointure)points. Massaging them again would help me even more. I had always been dubious about accupuncture until that day, the greater then my surprise when actually it helped me so much to relieve the pain. Needless to say that I still do not believe in acupuncture Ying Yand crap even with the best effort ;0. My cousin (a MD in France who studied accupuncture in Japan 20 years ago) advised me to massage these points myself whenever I felt that a migraine had started. Thats what I did from that day, and it really helped and changed my way of living with migraines. From that day on, I still have had migraines but: - very much less often and much less stronger - I dont really fear to have migraines, now that I know I can get it to be nearly painless and it does not make me sick anymore - I dont use anymore drugg or pills to treat it. Since that day, I showed this to anyone who says to experience a migraine or a strong headache which looks like a migraine. Friends and familly, and it worked fine 19 times out of 20. When it did not work, it just did not make thing worst, the headache did not go, period. The only issue here is that I can't show yoyou here, were these points are located cause I do not know anathomy that much and its vocabulary and my english vocabulary is not so good after all and is somewhat limited. I just can say that it is located roughly about an inch behind the ears, and I usually know where to locate it on friends. Just two points, one right one left. Nothing extraordinary in fact but when shown by someone, yoyou dont(want to)forget where these points are. Sometimes though on some friends, I had harder time to find these points but it paid off only when I exactly found them. I remember as well that at first I would not remember where they were located. I had to ask a second time my cousin to help me to locate them back. So the best advice would be to go and see an accupuncture specialist who can help yoyou to locate and show how to locate these 2 points if yoyou ever want to explore this option. In that regard to choosing a specialist, I have no specific advice to give, nor can't recommend anyone. I just can say that it is an option that worked for me a lot, and it helped friends too. Just for the sake of it, I looked here and there on the web to see if I could find some info about these points and the effect they are meant to treat. I just can't find anything related or close. Please tell me if yoyou find something on your side. On my side, I'll get in touch with my cousin to try get more info about which exact point, wich meridian,etc... and give yoyou some new hope, cause it worked on me and on a lot of people I know.

Then the patient lies down on a special table under a camera (\"gamma camera\") that can see the thallium and make pictures. The thallium mixes with the blood in the bloodstream and heart's arteries and enters heart muscle cells. If a part of the heart muscle doesn't receive a normal blood supply, less than a normal amount of thallium will be in those heart muscle cells. The first pictures are made shortly after the exercise test and show blood flow to the heart during exercise. The heart is \"stressed\" during the exercise test -- thus the name \"stress test.\" The patient then lies quietly for 2-3 hours and another series of pictures is made. These show blood flow to the heart muscle during rest.",

The contraction of the heart (systole) causes the blood pressure to rise to its highest point, and relaxation of the heart (diastole) brings the pressure down to its lowest point. Blood pressure is strongest in the aorta, where the blood leaves the heart.

Drug-induced Hypoglycemia The first step in preventing drug-induced hypoglycemia is to maintain a proper diet. Diabetics may also find it necessary to monitor their blood-sugar levels on a regular basis. Low blood-sugar levels indicate that a person should immediately eat candy or some other sweet snack. Insulin pumps are also effective in maintaining the proper level of blood sugar. These pumps can be implanted under the skin and programmed to continuously release the correct amount of insulin. Idiopathic Hypoglycemia Idiopathic hypoglycemia can usually be controlled by learning and following certain dietary rules. These rules include the following: * Avoid overeating. * Never skip breakfast. * Include protein in all meals and snacks. * Limit intake of fats, refined sugar, and processed foods. * Become familiar with the sugar content in different kinds of vegetables and grain products. * Keep a food diary that can be used to predict which foods produce the symptoms of hypoglycemia. * Eat a regular but limited amount of fresh fruits. * Follow a diet that is high in fiber.",

Ancient Greek and Roman literature even discusses primitive toothpicks that were chewed on to help clean the teeth and mouth. As the years passed, toothpicks matured into the chew stick which was about the size of a modern pencil. One end was chewed into and became softened and brush-like while the opposite end was pointed and used as a pick to clean food and debris from between the teeth. The twigs used were carefully chosen from aromatic trees that had the ability to clean and freshen the mouth. The earliest literature showing the use of these twigs is found in Chinese literature at around 1600 BC. The first true bristled toothbrush also originated in China at around 1600 AD. At around 1780, the first toothbrush was made by William Addis of Clerkenald, England. Addis, and later, his descendants, manufactured the finest English brushes, where the handles were carved out of the bone of cattle and the heads of the natural bristles were placed in the bored holes made in the bone and kept in place by thin wire. The natural bristles were obtained from the necks and shoulders of swine, especially from pigs living in colder climates like Siberia and China. By the early 1800s the bristled brushes were in general use in Europe and Japan. In 1857, H. N. Wadsworth was credited as the first American to receive a toothbrush patent as America entered the growing toothbrush market. In 1844, the first toothbrush was manufactured by hand and patented as a 3-row brush of serrated bristles with larger tufts by Dr. Meyer L. Rhein. In 1885, the Florence Manufacturing Company of Massachusetts, in association with Dr.Rhein, began producing the Pro-phy-lac-tic brush for mass marketing in the United States. As technology progressed, synthetic bristles replaced the natural swine bristles. Nylon was first applied to the toothbrush at around 1938 and by 1939, electric toothbrushes arrived in an attempt to offer the public a brush that could simulate the action of a manual brush but with better results and cleaning performance. Hard to believe, but most Americans didn't brush their teeth until soldiers brought the Army's enforced habit back home from World War II. The first real electric toothbrush was produced in 1939, developed in Switzerland. The electrical toothbrush was first marketed in the United States in 1960 by Squibb. The brush was called the Broxodent. General Electric introduced a rechargeable cordless toothbrush in 1961. Interplak was the first rotary action electrical toothbrush for home use, introduced in 1987.",

            "Alpha -1-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a blood protein normally found in the fetus and in infants. The exact function of AFP is not known but because the structure is similar to albumin which is the most common protein in an adults blood they are thought to have similar functions which is to transport various substances around the body. As we age, we make less and less AFP. In the adult AFP is a non-specific marker for several types of cancer. It is most often elevated in liver cancer and is used as a marker for hepatocellular cancinoma. Usually an AFP of above 1000 ng/ml is highly suggestive of liver cancer. The normal range is 0-20 ng/ml. The problem is that AFP is not always elevated. In patients from high-incidence populations such as blacks from Africa or native Chinese 80-90% of patients will have elevated AFP with liver cancer. However only 50-70% of low-incidence patients such as Europeans or North Americans will have elevated AFP with liver cancer. So will it is good news that your friend has normal AFP, this can not be used to completely rule out cancer. Also keep in mind that while AFP is most closely associated with liver cancer (and I assume this is why the test was done) if they were looking for some other type of cancer the sensitivity and specificity will be different for different types of cancer."

Because sexual activity would usually tear this membrane, its presence has been considered a guarantor of virginity in societies that place a high value on female chastity before marriage. However, the hymen is a poor indicator of whether a woman has actually engaged in coitus, because the tissue may be torn or stretched through masturbation, or tampon use and other non-sexual acts before having sexual intercourse. Also, some females with intact hymens have had sexual intercourse. The size and shape of this opening (or openings) vary greatly from person to person. Some women are born with no hymen at all, while others have a closed or imperforate hymen. These women may require a gynecologist to perform a medical procedure called a hymenotomy to allow menstrual products to escape. Still other women have unusually thick hymens that may require a hymenotomy to prevent pain for the woman during sex. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen HYMEN A thin piece of skin that stretches over the opening of the vagina. There is a small opening in it to let blood flow out of the vagina during a period. People used to think that a HYMEN that wasn't broken meant a girl was a virgin.

Topical medications are deemed ineffective. Two common oral medications for fungal infections are Lamisil (terbinafine) and Sporanox (itraconazole). Lamisil is typically taken once daily for 12 weeks, while Sporanox is taken twice a day for one week each month, for three or four cycles. Over-the-counter options include Lamisil, available as an antifungal cream for toenail fungus. A generic alternative, Clotramizol, might be a more economical choice. Bag Balm, originally designed for cows' udders, is recommended for infections like ingrown toenails and insect bites due to its lanolin petroleum base.The cause of the infection determines the treatment approach. Fungal nail infections are considered cosmetic issues requiring oral medication like Lamisil. Bacterial infections may require antibiotics, and ingrown toenails can be managed with warm water soaks and NSAIDs. In some cases, drilling through the nail may be necessary, and if the condition worsens, professional intervention, such as nail removal, may be required."

Maybe once a week, draw a nice bath, and provide yourself with a pleasurable, drawn out experience. Take your time to enjoy everything about it. The rest of the time, just satisfy the urge when it bites, and nothing more. Don't let it take over your life. And don't let feelings of shame mentally torture yoyou either.

However, because extroversion is more common and (by definition) extroverts are more vocal, society often places pressure on introverts to behave more extroverted. That is, if yoyou don't like going to parties, surrounding yourself with people, or prefer a reading or solitary activities, many people conclude something is \"wrong\" with you. Introversion is not entirely about being social. Many introverts have no problems being social. Introversion is more about being internally focused as opposed to externally. That is, to generalize, introverts think something through, then speak. Extroverts speak in order to think something through (they think out loud). Introverts get frustrated by extroverts who speak without having thought things through. They also tend to be frustrated that when they speak, no one gives them due consideration (other extroverts simply assume the introvert is \"thinking out loud,\" too). Introverts are recharged by solitary activities, or activities involving few people. Extroverts are energized by social interaction. After being at a party for an hour, the introvert is drained and ready to go home, or maybe retire to a quiet place with a few close friends. The extroverts are just getting warmed up. Introverts have a few friends and lots of acquaintences whereas extroverts have lots of friends but few are close. For more information do a Yahoo search on Myers-Briggs personality typing or read Keirsey's book called \"Please Understand Me.\" There's also a good book specificly on introversion called \"The Introvert Advantage.\" I haven't read it, but Amazon.com also has a book called \"Sales for Introverts\" or something like that. I imagine it discusses more about being an introvert in an extroverted world (sales). Bottom line, if you're anti-social, yoyou need psychiatric treatment. If you're introverted, you're normal. However, it does behoove yoyou to learn to interact in a primarily extroverted world. If yoyou have significant difficulties, a psychologist can help yoyou overcome them.

Introversion is about internal focus, with introverts thinking through things before speaking, while extroverts may think out loud. Introverts recharge through solitary or small-group activities, while extroverts thrive on social interactions. Introverts may find it challenging in an extroverted world, but forcing extroversion may lead to frustration. It's normal to be introverted, and embracing your personality is encouraged. Psychiatric treatment is for antisocial behavior, not introversion. Learning to navigate in an extroverted world can be helpful, and psychologists can assist if needed. Encouragement is given to embrace your introverted self rather than forcing adaptation. The message suggests additional resources for understanding introversion, including books on Myers-Briggs typing and introversion advantages.

            "Methods of quitting Cold Turkey method Nicotine Replacement Methods (Patch, Gum, Nasal Spray) Behavioral Methods Cognitive Therapy Method Other Methods and adjuncts (acupuncture, hypnosis, medications) Factors for relapse while in the process of quitting Predictors of successful quitting Cold turkey method This is the prefered method used by so called self changers, people who quit on their own and without any nicotine replacement by gum, patch or nasal spray. Little is known about this method as any research study would influence the results as it would no longer be a spontaneous process. Strong motivational factors are believed to play the foremost role in successful quitting using this method. Nicotine replacement therapy In this method the nicotine delivered by the cigarette is replaced with nicotine delivered through the skin (transdermal nicotine or nicotine patch) , the nasal mucosa (nicotine nasal spray) or the buccal mucosa (nicotine chewing gum). Several well designed clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement the goal of which is to reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms. Transdermal Nicotine Patches The nicotine patch is usually well tolerated, and provides constant, steady nicotine blood levels throughout the day and night when worn. They are quite simple to use, help prevent weight gain, cravings, and nicotine withdrawal symptoms and are socially acceptable Side Effects of the patch Patches may cause a local skin reaction,and insomnia with nightmares may occur. Overdosing in nicotine is possible, especially if a person smokes while wearing the patch. Smoking while wearing a patch is dangerous and may lead to stroke or heart attack. Use of the patch requires abstinence from tobacco products...i.e. no smoking or chewing tobacco. Cost Patches are expensive and cost close to $100 per month of use. However bear in mind that smoking 1 ppd costs $1000 per year, which multipied by 10 years approximates the price of a car. Some people are tempted to cut the patch to save money. Nicoderm is the only patch that can be cut without destroying the patch's ability to deliver nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream reliably.. It is not unsafe to cut the other patches as far as I know. However cutting the other patches impairs the transdermal drug delivery system, and may not provide reliable blood levels of nicotine. the key word here is reliable. The total dose of nicotine in the patch does not correlate at a milligram to milligram equivalency to the dose delivered to the bloodstream. The drug delivery system of the patch ensures that nicotine is transported thryou the skin at a constant rate, and e ach manufacturer uses a different patented technology to do this. Only a portion of the total nicotine contained in the patch is transported thryou the skin. Individual differences in skin thickness, location of the applied patch, and other related factors play a role in the total dose delivered. 3 Step Tapering Method of using the patch o The 21 mg patch is worn daily for 6-8 weeks for quitters who smoked an average of 1 ppd ( 2 ppd quitters may require 2 patches to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms) o The 14 mg patch is then worn daily for the next 2 to 4 weeks if the ex smoker remains confident in his or her ability to not smoke and if urges or cravings to smoke are controlled. o The 7 mg patch is then worn for 2-4 weeks if the same criteria as above are met. o In the absence of cravings and urge to smoke the patch is then stopped entirely. It is important to individualize the tapering method . . . Some people require longer periods of use, others shorter. If cravings intensify , return to the next higher dose of the patch.

Commonly occurs at pressure points eg. elbows,knees,knuckles as well as scalp, trunk, arms & legs, external sex organs & less commonly it may erupt suddenly all over the body. In psoriasis, skin cells reproduce many times faster than normal & live only 3/4 days;the dead cells build up on the skin, forming thick,flaky patches. It is not an infection, & not contagious. It may be inherited; climate change, skin injury, infection, drug reaction, stress etc. can flare it up or worsen it.It is a chronic disease i.e. it can last a long time & can come back frequently. Eczema is also a chronic skin disorder that causes an intensely icthy, red, raised rash; may make the skin dry & flaky. Sometimes itchy blisters form , when they burst or when scratching damage the skin, the surface may be left moist & crusty. It's not contagious. Commonest cause is general allergic over sensitivity, common in people with asthma or hay fever. Sometimes it occurs in infants.Other causes are contact with irritants like detergents, soap, engine oil etc; contact with substances which the body has become allergic to, e.g nickel jewellery, watches etc;varicose veins causing lower leg eczema.",

Lice can develop resistance to permethrin products, and these products can aggravate asthma in some children, but both are relatively nontoxic. (Neem is sold in garden shops.) I've also heard that some California school systems are using a product called Lice-B-Gone, a non-toxic, multi-enzyme shampoo made from plant sources that seems to get rid of lice in a single application. It works by softening the glue that holds the nits (lice eggs) to the hair shaft and also dissolves the exoskeletons of adult lice. Since it contains no pesticides, Lice-B-Gone is considered safe for pregnant women, nursing mothers, young children and people with asthma. The comb mentioned by the earlier poster is helpful.

Sleeping likely simulates your basil metabolism. Yoyou can gain weight when your caloric intake is greater than what yoyou burn off. But it is slightly more complicated.

Also, if yoyou sleep too much and get little exercise, your muscles may atrophy (losing some weight) while actually gaining weight from additional fat. Bone density can be reduced very quickly for patients who must remain bedridden. The best way to lose weight may be to walk because it uses your largest (leg) muscles keeping them in tone and healthy. Good exercise may improve your mood and increase your metabolism long after yoyou stop the exercise. Most people do not eat while out on a daily walk.

Up to 25% of patients died from the surgery. This experience of the 1970\u2019s is still remembered by some physicians who are reluctant to recommend the Whipple operation. Today the Whipple operation has become an extremely safe operation in the USA. At tertiary care centers where a large numbers of these procedures are performed by a selected few surgeons, the mortality rate from the operation is less than 4%. Studies have shown that for good outcomes from the Whipple surgery, the experience of the center and the surgeon is important. At USC, Dilip Parekh M.D. has performed more than 100 consecutive Whipple type of procedures over the past 9 years with good outcomes. What is a Whipple operation? In the Whipple operation the head of the pancreas, a portion of the bile duct, the gallbladder and the duodenum is removed. Occasionally a portion of the stomach may also be removed. After removal of these structures the remaining pancreas, bile duct and the intestine is sutured back into the intestine to direct the gastrointestinal secretions back into the gut. Laparoscopic Whipple operation At USC, Dr Parekh is developing techniques for a laparoscopic Whipple operation. At present this procedure may be offered at USC to selected patients with chronic pancreatitis, cystic tumors and islet cell tumors of the pancreas and patients who have ampullary cancer. We do not offer the laparoscopic Whipple operation for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The Whipple operation is performed laparoscopically utilizing a laparoscopic hand-access device. When is a Whipple operation required A Whipple operation is performed for cancer of the head of the pancreas cancer of the duodenum cholangiocarcinoma (cancer of the the bottom end of the bile) cancer of the ampulla \u2013 an area where the bile and pancreatic duct enter into the duodenum. whipple operation may also sometimes be performed for patients with benign (non-cancerous) disorders such as chronic pancreatitis and benign tumors of the head of the pancreas. What is the results of the Whipple surgery? Over the last 15 years major pancreatic centers in the United States have developed excellent results for the Whipple surgery. In almost all the major centers the death rate from this surgery is now less than 5%. Recent studies from Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering have shown that outcome from surgery for a Whipple operation is dependent on the experience of the hospital and the surgeon performing the surgical operation. In those that hospitals that perform high volume of these procedures the death rate from the Whipple operation is now less than 5%. In hospitals that infrequently perform the Whipple operation a much higher complication rate and the death rate from the surgery often greater than 15 to 20% has been reported in surgical literature. The American Cancer Society recommends that the Whipple operation should be performed in a center that is experienced and does high volume of these complex surgical procedures to ensure the best outcome. What is the experience of the Whipple operation at USC? At USC Dilip Parekh, MD has performed more than a hundred consecutive Whipple operations without any deaths from the surgical procedure. Will the Whipple operation improve my survival? The overall survival after the whipple operation for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is about 20% at five years after surgery. Patients without spread of cancer into their lymph nodes may have up to a 40% survival.

Because these senses contribute substantially to our enjoyment of life, our desire to eat, and be social, smell and taste disorders can be serious. When smell and taste are impaired, life loses some zest. We eat poorly, socialize less, and as a result, feel worse. Many older people experience this problem. Smell and taste also warn us about dangers, such as fire, poisonous fumes, and spoiled food. Certain jobs require that these senses be accurate-chefs and firemen rely on taste and smell. One study estimates that more than 200,000 people visit a doctor with smell and taste disorders every year, but many more cases go unreported. Loss of the sense of smell may be a sign of sinus disease, growths in the nasal passages, or, in rare circumstances, brain tumors",

The loss of the sense of smell could indicate sinus disease, nasal growths, or, in rare cases, brain tumors.

The tests commonly used to detect HIV infection actually look for antibodies produced by your body to fight HIV. Most people will develop detectable antibodies within 3 months after infection, the average being 20 days.During the time between exposure and the test, it is important to avoid any behavior that might result in exposure to blood, semen, or vaginal secretions.

This pressure can cause muscle spasms, pain, weakness or even numbness into the arms or legs. I work for a chiropractor who has treated a lot of patients with similar injuries from car accidents and they have received tremendous relief with their pains from chiropractic care. Also, yoyou should look into a new technology in chiropractic called the Pro-Adjuster. It takes the twisting, popping, and cracking out of chiropractic adjustments.

Likewise, they make a leg exercise \"boot\" that has a bar going through it that yoyou can attach weights to and it has a clamp to hold them on. Yoyou sit on a chari and extend your leg, and do that a bunch of times. As people suggest, yoyou can also do the standard exercises - calesthenics: situps, knee-bends, push-ups. Those do not take up much space. If yoyou buy those little strap-on weights for your wrists and ankles, that will increase the resistence. Yoyou can also get chin-up bars that yoyou can put in doorways. They go up towards the top of the frame. Yoyou can also get those things they sell on TV commercials. The wheel thing that yoyou hold while yoyou are in a prone position and yoyou pull it toward yoyou and push it back. Spinning, on one of those spinning pads, probably works some of your muscles a little too. Getting a Soloflex or one of those types of resisitence machines is pretty expensive but they do not take up much space and then yoyou can give yourself a serious workout. There are also step aerobics - yoyou just have to buy the step and use it at home. Though aerobics are not going to build up a lot of mass. They will help your endurance some though, and that will help yoyou work out longer/harder.",

Then put your hands on them and dont touch the floor. Start doing a push up on them. This works the chest. Then for the stomach, I do a special push up. I lay flat on the floor on my stomach. Then I prop my feet up into pushup position. I put my hands out there. I put them together so that they touch. Now I try to do a push up with them. This works the stomach really really fast. I do pushups for my arms. And then, before I go to sleep. I lay on my back on my bed or floor. I bend my knees. I reach my hands to rest them onto my knees. I dont hold onto my knees, just rest them. And I stay in this position for as long as I can. I do this twice before I sleep. Now, for legs, I do squats. For calves, I stand, and I lift my heels. First, yoyou should start doing both legs at the same time. Hold onto a door if yoyou have to. Sometimes people are not used to this. Then when my calves get stronger, I do them one at a time. I hold onto a door just in case. This should get yoyou started. Eventually, yoyou will get big. Just remember, 70% of working out is in your diet. I eat like 80% fruits and vegetables.

This imaginative play is considered normal and serves as a window into a child's world, providing insights into their fears and challenges. Imaginary friends are generally not a cause for concern unless they negatively impact a child's daily life. In contrast, schizophrenia is a medical disorder with biological roots, involving hallucinations and delusions. The presence of imaginary friends in children is socially accepted, given their developmental stage and fewer responsibilities, whereas adults exhibiting similar behaviors might face challenges in daily functioning. It's essential to distinguish between these experiences and recognize that psychopathological concerns arise when such behaviors significantly disrupt a person's life."

            "Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression) Another type of depression is bipolar disorder, which was formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression. This condition shows a particular pattern of inheritance. Not nearly as common as the other types of depressive disorders, bipolar disorder involves cycles of depression and mania, or elation. Bipolar disorder is often a chronic, recurring condition. Sometimes, the mood switches are dramatic and rapid, but most often they are gradual. When in the depressed cycle, the person can experience any or all of the symptoms of a depressive disorder. When in the manic cycle, any or all of the symptoms listed under mania may be experienced. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase. A significant variant of bipolar disorder is designated as bipolar II. (The usual form of bipolar disorder is referred to as bipolar I.) Bipolar II is a syndrome in which the affected person has repeated depressive episodes punctuated by what is called hypomania (mini-highs). These euphoric states in bipolar II do not fully meet the criteria for the complete manic episodes that occur in bipolar I. Depression Symptoms of Manic Depression Persistently sad, anxious, or \"empty\" mood. Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness. Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed, including sex. Insomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping. Decreased appetite and/or weight loss, or overeating and weight gain. Fatigue, decreased energy, being \"slowed down.\" Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts. Restlessness, irritability. Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions. Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic pain. Mania Symptoms of Manic Depression Inappropriate elation. Inappropriate irritability. Severe insomnia. Grandiose notions. Increased talking speed and/or volume. Disconnected and racing thoughts.

            "The herpes infection has a history dating back to ancient Greece. The word 'herpes' was used by Hippocrates to describe lesions that 'creep' or 'crawl.' Although previously well characterized, it was not until 1893 that the transmissibility was recognized.6 The herpes family of viruses currently is thought to consist of herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes virus VI, VII, and VIII.5 All are capable of entering and replicating in epithelial cells, while some of the herpes family is neurotropic and others are lymphotropic. HSV-1 and HSV-2 are neurotropic, infecting sensory nerve fibers and have been demonstrated to reproduce in epithelial cells. HSV-1 and HSV-2 are lytic to human epithelial cells and latent in neural tissue at the site of regional ganglions. Usually the virus initially enters the body through a break in the mucous membrane integrity, although there is evidence that it may penetrate intact skin. In either case, transmission results from mucocutaneous contact with infected secretions and aerosols. When reactivated, the virus travels along the nerve axon to the surface epithelial cells and can cause a recurrent epithelial outbreak. http://www.thejcdp.com/issue009/tilliss/10tillis.htm",

And how much water yoyou need depends on many factors, including your health status, how active yoyou are and where yoyou live. Though no single formula fits all people, several guidelines are available to help yoyou estimate how much to drink each day. Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase \u2014 or decrease \u2014 your water requirements. Health benefits of water Water is crucial to your health. It makes up, on average, 60 percent of your body weight. Every system in your body depends on water. Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when yoyou don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration \u2014 as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight \u2014 can sap your energy and make yoyou tired.

Signs and symptoms of dehydration include: Excessive thirst Fatigue Headache Dry mouth Little or no urination Muscle weakness Dizziness Lightheadedness How much water do yoyou need? Every day yoyou lose water through sweating \u2014 noticeable and unnoticeable \u2014 exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, yoyou need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do yoyou need? This isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and \"out of habit.\" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate. Replacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. Yoyou lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so yoyou if yoyou consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, yoyou can replace the lost fluids. Eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the \"8 x 8 rule\" \u2014 drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, \"drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,\" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. Dietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes. Yoyou can choose any of these fluid intake approaches to gauge your fluid needs. But your current total fluid intake is probably OK if yoyou drink enough water to quench your thirst, produce a colorless or slightly yellow normal amount of urine, and feel well. Factors that influence water needs Yoyou may need to modify total fluid intake from these recommended amounts depending on several factors, including how active yoyou are, the climate, your health status, and if you're pregnant or breast-feeding. Exercise. If yoyou exercise or engage in any activity that makes yoyou sweat, you'll need to drink extra water to compensate for that fluid loss.

        "question": "What is the most successful treatment for Peyronies Disease?",
        "answers": [
            "Medications: Over the years, a wide variety of medications have been used to treat Peyronie\u2019s disease. Some patients have benefitted, while others have found their medications seemed to make little difference. This variation in treatment outcome and the resulting lack of consensus regarding the drug(s) of choice reflects in part an uncertainty with strategy. While doctors can\u2019t say with precision what causes the disorder in each individual case, there does seem to be a common disease-producing process in all men. Yet where, in this complex spectrum extending from early wound healing to late scar formation, do we intervene with medications? This question remains a topic of clinical research. In general, changes in tissue elasticity that accompany the inflammation of early Peyronie\u2019s disease are reversible, whereas the loss of elasticity associated with the end-stage scarring characteristic of the later illness is not. Since it is a consequence of local change in elasticity, bending responds best to medical therapy in the early stage, a period that generally lasts about six months. In order to evaluate medical treatments, we should know how a case of Peyronie\u2019s disease evolves on its own, in the absence of therapy. Understanding this so-called natural history of the disease provides a basis for comparison, and a means for deciding when surgical intervention may be appropriate. During the intial six months of the disorder, erections can be painful. Eventually, even in the absence of treatment, the pain usually goes away. Unfortunately, bending does not always follow the same pattern. Though it may improve or resolve spontaneously in a minority of men, most untreated men with Peyronie\u2019s disease will retain some degree of penile distortion. Most medical treatments have a success rate of about 60% in improving bending. Some factors associated with a tendency for bending to persist are: the presence of dupuytren\u2019s contractures, the presence of heavy plaque calcification, and the presence of severe (greater than 45 degrees) curvature. Some of the contemporary medications in use are: VITAMIN E: this anti-oxidant has other uses in the treatment of scars, and has been employed in the treatment of Peyronie\u2019s disease since 1945. POTABA or potassium para amino benzoate is designated by the FDA as \"possibly effective\". Large doses are required, which may cause intestinal upset. COLCHICINE is a medication used for many years in the treatment of gout. It acts against inflammation, and interferes with the manufacture of scar tissue. VERAPAMIL is usually given by direct injection into the plaque. It also interferes with the synthesis of scar tissue precursors. COLLAGENASE is an investigational drug that enzymatically digests scar. Surgical Treatment: Who should consider an operation? Candidates for surgery should fufill four basic criteria. First and foremost is severity. The risks and expense of an operation only make sense when bending or deformity is severe enough to seriously interfere with sexual function. Secondly, natural healing or spontaneous resolution should have been given an opportunity. This is usually accomplished by deferring the decision for surgery at least twelve months from the time of onset. During this time the third criteria can be satisfied - an adequete trial of some form of medical therapy. Finally, no operation should be done on a man whose condition is changing, either for the better or worse. The best surgical outcomes are in men with stable (unchanging) condition. What are the risks of surgery? Unfortunately, surgery does not offer a cure for Peyronie\u2019s disease. The scarring in men with deformity severe and persistant enough to warrant an operation represents an irreversible loss of connective tissue elasticity. Though surgical restoration of sexual function can be both effective and reliable, potential candidates need to understand the compromise inh",
            "Treatment: I. a). Mild Curvature with good erections - no treatment is needed unless the patient insists on cosmetic improvement. This is handled by (1) making the long side shorter, with a series of plication sutures or, (2) making the short side longer by incising the plaque transversely. Usually nothing further is needed; a tissue graft is rarely necessary. I. b). Mild curvature with poor erections - The erectile dysfunction is the chief problem here and can be treated by the intra-urethral pellet, Muse; Viagra; or a penile prosthesis. Intracavernosal self-injection theoretically could make the curvature worse, so I prefer to avoid it. Experience suggests that in these patients erectile dysfunction often worsens faster than might otherwise be expected. The penile prosthesis is an attractive option in these cases. II. a). Moderate to severe curvature with good erections - here the curvature is the problem. This is treated by making the short side longer or the long side shorter. The latter tends to shorten the penis, and patients do not happily accept a shorter penis. Therefore, the short side is made longer by exposing the plaque and making a series of short elliptical transverse incisions through the plaque down to, but not into, the spongy tissue, making the plaque discontinuous - dividing it into disconnected segments - allows the penis to expand symmetrically on erection. To do this it may be necessary to elevate the neurovascular bundle. Temporary, patchy sensory loss may occur postoperatively but I have never seen it permanent, or even last longer than 3 months. II. b). Moderate to severe curvature with poor erections - the penile prosthesis has been very successful with these patients. Just by inflating the prosthesis alone, adequate straightening may occur. Often inflating the prosthesis by manually \"molding\" the penis gently but firmly bending it opposite the curve - additional straightening can nearly always be obtained. If still more straightening is needed, an incision is made and the plaque exposed and incised or excised. In those patients whose disease has left them with unacceptable shortening, we have obtained highly satisfactory results by combining the above procedures with a lengthening procedure. Significant length gain can be obtained in this manner. Patients can go home the same day or the next day. Intercourse can take place in 6 weeks. Complications can include bleeding, infection, numbness, shortening, inadequate curvature correction, discomfort lasting more than a few days. We have never seen permanent sensory loss, worsening of erections, or ejaculatory problems. It is important for patients to understand that while penile curvature can be markedly improved and erectile function restored, once the patient has Peyronie's disease, his penis will never be the same as before the disease developed."

        "labelled_summary": "Peyronie's disease has been treated with various medications, but the outcomes have varied among individuals, leading to uncertainty about the most effective drugs. The disease involves a spectrum from early inflammation to late scar formation, and the optimal timing for medical intervention remains a subject of clinical research. During the initial six months, erections can be painful, and while the pain often diminishes without treatment, penile bending does not always follow the same pattern. Medical treatments, including Vitamin E, POTABA, colchicine, verapamil, and collagenase, have had around a 60% success rate in improving bending. Surgery is considered for cases with severe deformity that significantly interferes with sexual function, typically after a waiting period of at least twelve months. Surgery does not cure Peyronie's disease but can restore sexual function effectively and reliably. The choice of treatment depends on factors such as the severity of curvature, the quality of erections, and the stability of the condition. Surgical options include plication sutures, incising the plaque, or using a penile prosthesis, depending on the degree of curvature and erectile function. The risks of surgery include potential shortening of the penis, temporary sensory loss, bleeding, infection, and discomfort, but permanent sensory loss or worsening of erections is rare. It's crucial for patients to understand that while penile curvature can be significantly improved and erectile function restored, the penis will not return to its pre-disease state."

These symptoms are unexplained infections (due to fewer white blood cells), unexpected bleeding (due to fewer platelets) and fatigue (due to fewer red blood cells). To confirm a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, a physician examines a blood sample and determines the number of each type of blood cell circulating in the blood.

            "it is contracted through direct skin contact (not necessarily in the genital area) with an infected person. The virus travels through tiny breaks in the skin or through moist areas, but symptoms may not appear for up to a month or more after infection. Transmission was thought to be most common during an active outbreak, however in the early 1980s scientists and doctors realized that the virus can be shed from the skin in the absence of symptoms. It is estimated that between 50 and 80% of new HSV-2 cases are from asymptomatic viral shedding. HSV asymptomatic shedding is believed to occur on 2.9% of days while on antiviral therapy, versus 10.8% of days without. Shedding is known to be more frequent within the first 12 months of acquiring HSV-2. There are some indications that some individuals may have much lower patterns of shedding, but evidence supporting this is not fully supported. Sex should always be avoided in the presence of symptomic lesions. Women are more susceptible to acquiring genital HSV-2 than men. On an annual basis, without the use of antivirals or condoms, the transmission risk from infected male to female is approximately 8-10%. This is believed to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is approximately 4-5% annually. Supressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios by about 50%, meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom free. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk by 50%. Condom use is much more effective at preventing male to female transmission than vice-versa. (Wald et al., 2001) The effects of combining antiviral and condom use is roughly additive, thus resulting in approximately a 75% combined reduction in annual transmission risk. It is important to note that these figures reflect experiences with subjects having frequently recurring genital herpes (>6 recurrences per year), subjects with low recurrence rates and those with no clinical manifestations were excluded from these studies.",

        "answers": [
            "The average human body is covered by about 20 square feet (2 square meters) of skin. Skin is the only organ that is constantly exposed to potential irritation. And, with so many things coming into contact with your skin daily, you're bound to get an itch or two. Serious itching can be caused by allergies, disease, emotions and infections, but let's take a look at what causes the common itches that aggravate yoyou everyday. Itching, also known as pruritus, starts with some kind of external stimuli, including bugs, dust, clothing fibers and hair. Like tickling, itching is a built-in defense mechanism that alerts your body to the potential of being harmed. In this case, it might be the potential of being bit by a bug. When the stimuli lands on your skin, it may not bother yoyou at first, but soon it will begin to rub back and forth across your skin. Once the hair or dust scratches your skin's surface layer, receptors in the dermis of the skin will become irritated. In a split second, these receptors send a signal through fibers in the skin to your spinal cord and then up to the cerebral cortex in your brain. The same fibers that send itching signals are also used to send pain signals to the brain, which once led some scientists to believe that itching was a form of light pain. That notion has since been dispelled by research, which showed that pain and itching elicit opposite responses. Pain causes us to withdraw and itching causes us to scratch. As soon as we feel an itch, our first natural response is to scratch the spot of the itch with our fingernails. The reason for this response is simple -- we want to remove the irritant as soon as possible. Once you've scratched the area of irritation, yoyou are likely to feel some relief. When your brain realizes that you've scratched away the irritant, the signal being sent to your brain that yoyou have an itch is interrupted and therefore no longer recognized by the brain. Even if yoyou don't remove the irritant, scratching will at least cause pain and divert your attention away from the itching. The irritant that caused the itching is very small, maybe only a few microns in length, so it disturbs only a few nerve endings. When yoyou use your fingernail to scratch the spot where the irritant is, yoyou not only remove the irritant but yoyou irritate a lot more nerve endings than the irritant.",

            "I have had fibromyalgia for over 10 years and when I first got it, I felt pretty much how yoyou described. It took me years of research and application to find what works best for me. Every person is individual, so yoyou will have to go by trial and error, but here is some of what I do... 1. Take an antidepressant. I've tried many prescribed by my doctor and found that even St.John's Wort works very well. The antidepressants raise your seretonin levels, (the feel good chemical in your brain,) and yoyou just generally feel better all over. 2. Get some exercise every day. Not too little, but not too much. Too little will allow your muscles to become stiff and sore but too much will make them ache like crazy. I find yoga and walking to be the two best exercises for me. I do them every day and my body feels 1000% better. 3. Eat a healthier diet. Too much sugar, white flour, fat and carbs, seem to exasperate the condition. Try to stick to natural foods, whole grains, fresh fruit and vegetables. 4. Get enough sleep and rest. Try to get 8 hours of sleep each night if possible. If yoyou have what I do, and wake up each night and toss and turn, try taking a herbal sleep remedy. Valerian and passionflower worked very well for me. They sell sleep remedy blends in health food stores and I find they really help. 5. Mediation and relaxation...even if it's only for 5 minutes a day, will make a big difference. I know yoyou said yoyou have 4 children, and I have 5, all boys, so I know it's really hard to get any time to meditate or relax, but it's really, really, important if yoyou are going to be any good to them. Yoyou have to take care of yourself. 6. Journalling. Again, I know this takes time, but it is the best way to get your feelings out of you. If yoyou don't have someone yoyou can share yoyou feeling with, then write about them. Holding all your feelings inside causes a lot of tension, and I believe that's where and how Fibromyalgia starts. Once I started writing, and crying, releasing some of my pain and withheld emotions, I really started feeling better. I wish yoyou all the best of luck. Yoyou are living with a difficult chronic condition. Take good care of yourself. That's always the best place to start. Take care. Kathy",
            "In my experience pain medications do not work. My best advise is make sure to get plenty of sleep, take a multiple vitamin, keep active in at least low impact sports, and consider Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements (consult the doctor or a nutritionist to have your Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful), meditation does help some in keeping the pain back if yoyou can seperate your mind from the pain, and try to take 2-3 warm Epson Salt baths a week (Epson salt contains Magnesium and soaking in a warm tub of it helps to get the mineral into the body. Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps, spasms, and pain.) Also, Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro. Try eliminating Monsodium Glutamate from your diet. I did and some of my symptoms (chronic headaches and nausea) went away. It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup. A few key finding's of an FDA study found MSG to cause a \"burning sensation in the back of the neck, forearms and chest\". It's not a wonder that yoyou are having problems concentrating, stress, and anxiety. Whey the body is in pain the brain kicks into fight of flight mode.

        "answers": [
            "Doctors do not always know what causes a stone to form. While certain foods may promote stone formation in people who are susceptible, scientists do not believe that eating any specific food causes stones to form in people who are not susceptible. A person with a family history of kidney stones may be more likely to develop stones. Urinary tract infections, kidney disorders such as cystic kidney diseases, and certain metabolic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism are also linked to stone formation. In addition, more than 70 percent of people with a rare hereditary disease called renal tubular acidosis develop kidney stones. Cystinuria and hyperoxaluria are two other rare, inherited metabolic disorders that often cause kidney stones. In cystinuria, too much of the amino acid cystine, which does not dissolve in urine, is voided. This can lead to the formation of stones made of cystine. In patients with hyperoxaluria, the body produces too much of the salt oxalate. When there is more oxalate than can be dissolved in the urine, the crystals settle out and form stones. Shapes of various stones. Sizes are usually smaller than shown here. Hypercalciuria is inherited. It is the cause of stones in more than half of patients. Calcium is absorbed from food in excess and is lost into the urine. This high level of calcium in the urine causes crystals of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate to form in the kidneys or urinary tract. Other causes of kidney stones are hyperuricosuria which is a disorder of uric acid metabolism, gout, excess intake of vitamin D, urinary tract infections, and blockage of the urinary tract. Certain diuretics which are commonly called water pills or calcium-based antacids may increase the risk of forming kidney stones by increasing the amount of calcium in the urine. Calcium oxalate stones may also form in people who have a chronic inflammation of the bowel or who have had an intestinal bypass operation, or ostomy surgery. As mentioned above, struvite stones can form in people who have had a urinary tract infection. People who take the protease inhibitor indinavir, a drug used to treat HIV infection, are at risk of developing kidney stones.",

It is also found that 70% of the people with a rare heriditary disease called renal tubular acidosis develop kidney stones.

Also ognion + garlic. * Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course) * If yoyou really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here. \u2022 Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order) * If yoyou are a vegetarian, then ignore this! * Avoid fat meat \u2022 Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet! \u2022 Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits * Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! * EVEN if they have \"low fat\" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES ! \u2022 About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... yoyou know! * Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods. * If yoyou like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner! * At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if yoyou are not a vegetarian). if you want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. you can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when yoyou work out do some taeboo. if you want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. you could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. you could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs 1) It is not just the amount yoyou eat, but what yoyou eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever. 2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for yoyou to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle \"burn\". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if yoyou have the money for or want to spend the money on it. 3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when yoyou wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must. 4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom. That is a good place to start... if yoyou see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer Keep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before yoyou sleep by 2 to 3 hours the most important thing is yoyou don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what yoyou want yoyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com good luck",

In 2002, Genphar, a company doing research for the United States Army's biodefense program, announced that an experimental vaccine protected animals from a high dose of Marburg virus. The tests were conducted by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). According to the company, all animals in the control group died within days whereas all animals that received the regular dosage of the vaccine were fully protected. The company has moved on to non-human primate trials. [4] Late in 2003, the US government awarded the company a contract worth $8.4 million for what was described as \"a multivalent Ebola, Marburg filovirus vaccine program\". In June 2005 scientists at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory announced that they had also developed vaccines for both Marburg and Ebola that showed significant promise in primate testing. Studies on mice also suggested that the vaccine might be an effective treatment for the disease if it is administered shortly after a patient is infected. To make the vaccines the scientists fused a surface protein from the viruses they hope to protect against onto an animal virus - vesicular stomatitis - which is thought to be of no threat to humans.

Early use of vasopressors and careful hemodynamic monitoring is crucial for managing hypotension and shock. Patients may not respond well to fluid infusions, and caregivers must adhere to strict barrier infection control measures. Some research groups, including Genphar, have developed experimental vaccines showing promise in animal trials, with potential effectiveness if administered shortly after infection. These vaccines involve fusing surface proteins from target viruses onto a non-threatening animal virus, such as vesicular stomatitis."

The only way I could effectively keep my weight down was to find way that I really enjoyed that would burn off those calories. My friend turned me on to boxing. Not kick boxing aerobics (not that theres anything wrong with that) but it was training with a real boxing trainer. Three times a week I would go into the gym for an hour and half and cover my self in abaleen (makes yoyou sweat more) and then put on a sauna suit and get in the ring. He would hold mits and make me punch until my arms could punch anymore. He would put me through the same kind of training as he would if I was training to really fight. (Even though I have no intention of ever doing that) We would weigh in at the beginning of every work out and then again at the end and on average yoyou left about 1 to 2 pounds lighter from sweating so much. It was an amazing stress releaser, and very cool from a self defense aspect as well. sorry to get off on a tangent about boxing as boxing isn't for everyone but my point was find a way to work out that yoyou enjoy and that doesn't feel like a chore.

            "It's 3500 calories. And no it's not that simple as some will lead yoyou to believe. Yoyou don't mention anything about your diet so I don't actually know how many calories you're consuming on a daily basis (or what foods). The main idea is to maintain a calorie deficit so if you're not losing weight, chances are you're consuming more than your expending. Make sure yoyou make wise food decisions: http://preventdisease.com/fitness/nutrition/articles/healthyeating.html. Try and make sure your last meal is 5 hours before yoyou sleep. If yoyou must have something after that point it should only be a protein shake or water. Stick to complex carbs (brown rice, potatoes) before 6pm and no carbs after 6pm. Balance acid forming foods with base forming food to optimize digestion. http://preventdisease.com/fitness/nutrition/articles/acid_alkaline.html# Cutting 500 calories a day will do nothing if your exceeding your calorie expediture. For energy requirements, the first thing yoyou have to do is assess your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)& AMR (Active Metabolic Rate) to assess your daily energy requirements. http://preventdisease.com/healthtools/articles/bmr.html Once yoyou have established how many calories yoyou burn per day, your goal should then be to maintain the calorie deficit on a daily basis for gradual weight loss is achieved. If your goal is to cut back on 500 calories through exercise and your combined BMR & AMR is 3000, then yoyou better be sure yoyou are not consuming more than 2500 calories. Track your progress daily in a journal and tweak either your diet or activity level according to your progress until yoyou get it right. It's doubtful yoyou are burning 700-800 calories by walking 50 minutes unless yoyou are over 250 pounds and your rate is very brisk. Use this calculator to help yoyou figure it out. http://preventdisease.com/healthtools/articles/while_walking200.html",
            "Actually, it is a established fact that 3500 calories are equal to one pound. What is less accurate are the calorie outputs displayed on fitness machines. They can approximate what your expended effort based on your weight will be, but they are FAR from accurate. Under no circumstances should yoyou assume they are correct. Instead, use them as a guideline or reference to help yoyou quantify your cardio effort. Weight loss is a long-term effort, and while fitness is a key element, it isn't the only part of the equation. Keep it up--consistentcy is what will guarantee your success.",
            "A pound of fat is in fact 3500 calories(10% of your body fat is water). All calculation have been made. If yoyou cut 500cal 7 days yoyou will loose 1 pound of fat. But yoyou must cut them from the amount your are totaly burning each day) ---- No, not all calories are created equal. Simple! Example: eating 2000 calories from chips will not give yoyou the same result as eating 2000 calories from meat. But yet the reason most people are overweight is OVEREATING not due to a bad metabolism. Yoyou will find a lot of conflicting advice about the best time to run. Don't get either way caught up(unless yoyou are preparing for a contest than yoyou should run in the morning). If yoyou find that yoyou are running 6 times/week and plateayou try to change your diet and not your running routine. Why not the running routine? Well, simple, yoyou will find yourself soon running 2 times per day, seven day a week just to mantain. This is called the adaption syndrome. DO AS MUCH IS NEED TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL. IN EXCESS IT IS BAD. Aerobic Adaption syndrome happens to aerobic instructors which train several classes a day and despite their high energy expenditure they have problem loosing fat.",
            "Each gram of fat has 9 calories, and a pound is 454 grams, so that should be around 4000 calories, though I've seen the 3500 figure quoted also. All calories are exactly the same, and yoyou lose weight if yoyou burn more than yoyou take in, no matter what. So if yoyou stuff yourself all day with fries, ice cream, chocolates and cake, yoyou will still lose weight if yoyou burn one more calorie than yoyou ate. But yoyou might find it hard to exercise enough to burn *that* many calories, not to mention the fact that weight-loss isn't the only thing, and even if yoyou did lose weight yoyou might end up with diabetes and cardio-vascular disease on such a diet. So you're much better off eating right, staying healthy, and exercising enough to burn just as many calories as yoyou consume, or a few extra if yoyou want to shed some pounds."

Cutting 500 calories per day for a week is commonly believed to result in a one-pound fat loss, but the quality of calories consumed matters; not all calories have the same impact on the body. Overeating, rather than a slow metabolism, is often the primary cause of overweight issues. Changing diet rather than running routines is recommended to overcome plateaus in weight loss. The Aerobic Adaption syndrome illustrates the challenge of maintaining fat loss despite high energy expenditure. While some sources suggest a pound of fat contains 4000 calories, the commonly cited figure remains 3500 calories per pound. The overarching principle for weight loss is burning more calories than consumed, regardless of the calorie source."

            "Many young children put nonfood items in their mouths at one time or another. They're naturally curious about their environment, and they may, for instance, eat some dirt out of the sandbox. Kids with pica, however, go beyond this innocent exploration of their surroundings. As many as 25% to 30% of kids (and 20% of those seen in mental health clinics) have an eating disorder called pica, which is characterized by persistent and compulsive cravings (lasting 1 month or longer) to eat nonfood items. What Is Pica? The word pica comes from the Latin word for magpie, a bird known for its large and indiscriminate appetite. Pica is most common in people with developmental disabilities, including autism and mental retardation, and in children between the ages of 2 and 3. Although kids younger than 18 to 24 months can try to eat nonfood items, it isn't necessarily considered abnormal at that age. Pica is also a behavior that may also surface in children who've had a brain injury affecting their development. It can also be a problem for some pregnant women, as well as people with epilepsy.",

            "Cherubism: A genetic disorder of childhood that leads to prominence of the lower face and an appearance reminiscent of the cherubs portrayed in Renaissance art. Cherubism is due to a problem in bone formation that is largely limited to the upper and lower jaws (the maxilla and mandible) with loss of bone in the jaws and its replacement by excessive amounts of fibrous tissue. These abnormalities often resolve after puberty. Cherubism is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. Most boys and girls with it have a parent who had cherubism, while the few children with cherubism without a family history are thought to have a new mutation (a newly arisen gene) for cherubism but can transmit it to their children. The gene for cherubism is on chromosome 4. It is specifically in chromosome band 4p16.3 and is called SH3BP2 (for SH3-domain binding protein 2). Exactly how a mutation in SH3BP2 leads to cherubism is not yet known.",
            "It's a hereditary and progressive bilateral swelling at the angle of the mandible, sometimes involving the entire jaw. It is called cherubism because the swelling imparts a cherubic look to the face, in some cases enhanced by upturning of the eyes."

Typically, these abnormalities resolve after puberty. Cherubism is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition, with most affected individuals having a parent with the disorder. In cases where there is no family history, a new mutation is suspected, which can still be transmitted to the person's children. The gene associated with cherubism is located on chromosome 4, specifically in chromosome band 4p16.3, and is known as SH3BP2 (SH3-domain binding protein 2). The precise mechanism by which mutations in SH3BP2 cause cherubism is not yet fully understood. Clinically, cherubism presents as a hereditary and progressive bilateral swelling, often involving the entire jaw, leading to a cherubic appearance of the face, accentuated in some cases by upturned eyes."

Diet and medications are probably worth an effort -- and new meds have come on line in the last 5 to 10 years. An odd factoid: Nicotine seems to delay the onset in most adults by several years. Personal observation: My mom had pretty severe Crohns and, while the local docs wanted to do surgery, the advice she got from the Mayo clinic was to hold off. A few years later, she ended up with a heart transplant and the med regime for that (a fairly nasty mix to be sure) put the Crohns into more or less permanent remission.",

Second generation anti-histamines do not have a useful effect on colds. A warm and humid environment and drinking lots of fluids, especially hot liquids, alleviate symptoms somewhat. Common home remedies include camomile or lemon tisanes and chicken soup (which probably work by soothing the irritated respiratory passages with their steam), nebulized medicinal mixtures, hot compresses, mustard plasters, hot toddies, licorice and echinacea. Although there have been scientific studies done on echinacea, its effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Eating very spicy food can help alleviate congestion, although it may also irritate the already-tender throat. Coffee, or its active component, caffeine, has also been shown to improve mood and mental performance during rhinovirus infection. Hot beer is also recommended, and though it probably does little to fight the infection directly, at least it can help to a good night of relaxed sleep. However, alcohol dehydrates the body which is counterproductive; also cold medicine (aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, etc) should never be taken along with alcohol.",

        "question": "Dissociative Identity Disorder: Do the multiple personalities need to be fused ?",
        "answers": [
            "This is from the Merck Manual: \"All successful treatments that aim to achieve integration involve psychotherapy that specifically addresses the dissociative identity disorder. Some patients are unable or unwilling to pursue integration. For them, treatment aims to facilitate cooperation and collaboration among the personalities and to reduce symptoms. This treatment is often arduous and painful, and many crises tend to arise as a result of the personalities' actions and the patient's despair when dealing with traumatic memories. One or more periods of psychiatric hospitalization may be necessary to help some patients through difficult times and during the processing of particularly painful memories. Hypnosis is often used to help access the personalities, facilitate communication between them, and stabilize and interpret them. Hypnosis is also used to discuss traumatic memories and diffuse their impact. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), applied cautiously, is a useful adjunct. EMDR tries to process traumatic memories and to replace negative thoughts about self that are associated with these memories with positive ones. Generally, two or more psychotherapy sessions per week for 3 to >= 6 years are necessary to integrate the personalities or to achieve harmonious interaction among them that allows normal functioning without symptoms. Integration of the personalities is the most desirable outcome. Psychotherapy has three main phases. In the first phase, the priority is safety, stabilization, and strengthening of the patient in anticipation of the difficult work of processing traumatic material and dealing with problematic personalities. The personality system is explored and mapped to plan the remainder of the treatment. In the second phase, the patient is helped to process the painful episodes of his past and to mourn the losses and other negative consequences of the trauma. As the reasons for the patient's remaining dissociations are addressed, therapy can move to the final phase, in which the patient's selves and relationships and social functioning can be reconnected, integrated, and rehabilitated. Some integration occurs spontaneously, but much must be encouraged by conversing with and arranging the unification of the personalities or must be facilitated with imagery and hypnotic suggestion. After integration, patients continue treatment to deal with some issues that have not been resolved. After postintegration treatment appears complete, visits to the therapist are tapered but are rarely completely terminated. Patients come to think of the psychiatrist as someone who can help them deal with psychologic issues, just as they periodically need assistance from a primary care physician.\""

The process spans three phases: ensuring safety and stabilization, processing traumatic episodes, and reconnecting and rehabilitating the patient's selves, relationships, and social functioning. The therapeutic tools include hypnosis, which facilitates communication and memory processing, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) to address traumatic memories.

One theory of some substance is that people with vitiligo develop antibodies that, instead of protecting them, turn upon them and destroy their own melanocytes, the special cells that produce the pigment melanin that colors their skin. Another theory is that the melanocytes somehow attack and destroy themselves. Finally, some people with vitiligo have reported that a single event such as a severe sunburn or an episode of emotional distress seem to have triggered their vitiligo. Events of this nature, however, have not been scientifically proven to cause vitiligo and may simply be coincidences.",
            "Vitiligo is a dermatological condition characterized by the appearance of white patches of skin on different parts of the body as a result of the destruction of the cells that make pigment (melanocytes). This may vary from one or two white spots on the skin to large areas of depigmentation. Vitiligo is not contagious. It seems to occur more often among people who have certain autoimmune diseases. For some people, although not for everyone, the depigmentation is progressive."

        "answers": [
            "Anemia occurs because patients either can't produce enough red blood cells or because red blood cells are lost (bleeding) or destroyed faster than they can be produced. Many different causes of anemia exist. Iron deficiency anemia. This is the most common type of anemia. It happens when yoyou don't have enough iron in your body. Yoyou need iron to make hemoglobin. This can happen when yoyou lose blood from problems like heavy periods, ulcers, colon polyps, or colon cancer. A diet that doesn't have enough iron in it can also cause IDA. Pregnancy can also cause IDA if there's not enough iron for the mother and fetus. Megaloblastic (or vitamin deficiency) anemia. This most often happens when your body doesn't get enough folic acid or vitamin B-12. These vitamins help your body keep healthy blood and a healthy nervous system. With this type of anemia, your body makes red blood cells that can't deliver oxygen right. Sometimes, with this disease, your health care provider may not realize you're not getting enough B-12. This usually happens to someone with pernicious anemia, a type of autoimmune disease. B-12 deficiency may also be more common in people with other autoimmune diseases, like Crohn's disease. Not getting enough B-12 can cause numbness in your legs and feet, problems walking, memory loss, and problems seeing. The treatment depends on the cause. But yoyou may need to get B-12 shots or take special B-12 pills. Underlying diseases. Certain diseases can hurt the body's ability to make red blood cells. For example, people with kidney disease, especially those getting dialysis (takes out wastes from your blood if your kidneys can't), are at higher risk for developing anemia. Their kidneys can't create enough hormones to make blood cells, and iron is lost in dialysis. Inherited blood disease. If yoyou have a blood disease in your family, there is a higher risk that yoyou will also have this disease. One type of inherited blood disease is sickle cell anemia. Instead of having normal red blood cells that move through blood vessels easily, sickle cells are hard and have a curved edge. These cells cannot squeeze through small blood vessels and block the organs from getting blood. Your body destroys sickle red cells quickly, but it can't make new red blood cells fast enough. This causes anemia. Another inherited blood disease is thalassemia. It happens when the body is missing certain genes or when variant (different from normal) genes are passed down from parents that affect how the body makes hemoglobin. Aplastic anemia. This rare problem happens when your body doesn't make enough red blood cells. Since this affects the white blood cells too, there is a higher risk for infections and bleeding that can't be stopped. This can be caused by many things: cancer treatments (radiation or chemotherapy) exposure to toxic chemicals (like those used in some insecticides, paint, and household cleaners) some drugs (like those that treat rheumatoid arthritis) autoimmune disease(like lupus)viral infection that affects bone marrow or bone marrow diseases",
            "Anemia (American English) or anaemia (Commonwealth English), which literally means \"without blood,\" is a deficiency of red blood cells and/or hemoglobin. This results in a reduced ability of blood to transfer oxygen to the tissues, and this causes hypoxia; since all human cells depend on oxygen for survival, varying degrees of anemia can have a wide range of clinical consequences. Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells) has to be present to ensure adequate oxygenation of all body tissues and organs. The three main classes of anemia include excessive blood loss (acutely such as a hemorrhage or chronically through low-volume loss), excessive red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production. In menstruating women, dietary iron deficiency is a common cause of deficient red blood cell production. Follow the link for more information. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia",

Kidney disease, particularly in those on dialysis, elevates the risk of anemia due to hormonal and iron imbalances.

Thalassemia happens when the body is missing certain genes or when variant (different from normal) genes are passed down from parents that affect how the body makes hemoglobin. Sickle cell anemia occurs when the body gets rid of sickle red cells quickly, but can't replace them with healthy new red blood cells. Anothwer type of anemia is aplastic anemia, which can be caused by factors such as cancer treatments, chemicals, drugs, autoimmune diseases, or viral infections, affects both red and white blood cells. Anemia, characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin, leads to impaired oxygen transfer in the blood, potentially causing various health issues.

            "How to Hear What Your Body Needs The SAD diet (standard American diet) really is sad. Most of us consume so much damaged fat, toxic chemicals, sugar, and processed, unhealthy foods that we have lost touch with what our bodies really need. Eating should be an intuitive process, but there are things that can interfere with intuitive eating. * Being caught up in research and theories about the \"best\" diet. The value of intuition in eating is lost in our knowledge and science-driven world. Animals instinctively know everything they need to live and they do it. We have the same instinct, but it gets lost in what we are told we should eat by researchers, diet gurus, parents, spouses, talk show hosts, magazines, celebrities and friends. * Making weight loss your primary focus. The weight loss industry in the United States is a billion dollar industry. It can harm your metabolism, your wallet, and your confidence. Many chronic dieters develop long-term side effects from being on the wrong diet, such as fatigue and weakness, anxiety, depression, dark circles under the eyes, headaches, joint pain, and poor concentration. They can deprive your body of essential nutrients that it needs to rebuild and can stimulate the release of stress hormones. * Chronic stress or illness. Many people under chronic stress lose their taste for food. They view food as fuel or they lose sensitivity to hunger signals. Chronic stress can destabilize blood sugar levels resulting in increased cravings and a constant need to eat. People sometimes become hungry soon after meals and feel lightheaded and faint if they are not able to eat. In addition, chronic stress can trigger irritable bowel, bloating, gas, and pain regardless of what yoyou eat. How to improve your intuitive ability 1. Start by paying attention to how different foods make yoyou feel. * What foods leave satisfied? * What foods give yoyou energy? * What foods make yoyou tired or unable to concentrate? * What foods make yoyou anxious or edgy vs. calm and content? * What foods make yoyou bloated, uncomfortable, or cause pain? 2. Reduce the amount of junk foods and sugar in your diet. * Substitute fruit and then gradually decrease. If yoyou have a sweet tooth, try to gradually substitute the sugar in your diet with fruit. Fruit contains sugar but also has fiber, phytochemicals and antioxidants. Gradually taper the fruit until yoyou are at a level that feels right to you. * Use a herbal sweetener. The herbal sweetener Stevia can be used to add sweetness to any dish. Some brands are better than others -- if yoyou try a brand that tastes quite bitter, keep looking. * Try spices with a sweet flavor. The spices cinnamon and cloves have a sweet taste, even though they don't contain any sugar. Try making Chai tea, or adding cinnamon to drinks, sauces and desserts for a sweet flavor. * Healthier sweeteners. If yoyou do use sugar, try mixing unrefined blackstrap molasses with just enough honey or another natural sweetener to take the bitter edge off the molasses. One tablespoon of blackstrap molasses contains about 179 mg of calcium and 518 mg of potassium. All natural sweeteners such as honey and molasses are still forms of sugar, so don't go overboard on these thinking they are okay."

        "question": "why is my ear popping when I'm not at a high altitude?",
        "answers": [
            "The other answer is correct -- there is a difference in air pressure in the space behind the eardrum (called the middle ear) and the air outside. This can happen when the Eustachian tube that connects the middle ear space to the back of the throat is not opening properly as it should when yawning or swallowing. The causes of this can be inflammation due to a cold or allergies. Some people have problems due to enlarged adenoids or tonsils. Other conditions can also cause the sensation of pressure in the middle ear, but are typically accompanied by other symptoms like spinning dizziness (vertigo) or ringing/buzzing in the ear (tinnitus). Ear wax (cerumen) build up can make yoyou feel clogged, but doesn't usually cause a popping sensation. A quick fix is to hold your nose and mouth closed and blow gently, which will force air pressure up into the middle ear space. This is called the Val Salva maneuver. Some people respond well to nasal allergy sprays or other allergy treatments. If the problem persists for more than a week or two see your doctor or an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.",

This imbalance is often caused by factors like inflammation due to colds or allergies, enlarged adenoids or tonsils, and less commonly, conditions associated with vertigo or tinnitus. Earwax buildup, while causing a feeling of being clogged, usually doesn't induce popping. The Val Salva maneuver, involving gently blowing with a closed nose and mouth, can help equalize ear pressure. While ear popping is generally harmless but uncomfortable, addressing underlying causes, such as allergies, is recommended, and seeking medical attention is advised if accompanied by more severe symptoms."

The massage, or slow movement of the muscle in a rhythmic fasion allows our bodies to purge the muscle of lactice acid to some extent. Normally it allows the person to 'sooth' the aches and pains of the cramping muscles. The massage is ideally performed in a standard up and down movement over the muscle. A kneading method is typically used to massage muscles that are overused. Percussion and chops are used mainly to remove extreme knots, ect and make the muscle regions more suceptable to kneading to remove the acid. However, it isn't just to remove acid from the muscle. Massaging the muscle also strenghtens it. It allows the muscle to move without too much effort, and allows the body to heal quicker from wounds directly related to the muscle. Hope that helped."

        "labelled_summary": "Eating later in the evening is often associated with weight gain because physical activity tends to decrease after 7 pm, leading to fewer calories burned. The idea is that weight gain \"stands still\" after 7 pm due to the moon, emphasizing the importance of considering the timing of meals. Consuming food later provides less time for the body to burn off calories, especially if followed by sedentary activities like watching TV before bedtime. The type of food consumed also matters; carbohydrates and sugars take longer to break down than foods higher in fat. Maintaining a daily caloric balance is crucial for body maintenance and physical activities. Eating earlier in the day is suggested for a more comfortable bedtime, as metabolism tends to slow down after 6 pm. Calories consumed later, especially right before bed, are less likely to be burned as energy and may be converted to fat."

If yoyou don't shower first, wet your hair for at least two minutes with warm, soapy water. Wet hair cuts better and easier than dry hair, and is more likely to cut evenly (and not at an angle). Use a good shaving cream to reduce friction and irritation. Really work the shaving cream into your scalp for at least two minutes, and save areas that tend to develope bumps for last when you're shaving, so that the shaving cream has longer to soften the hair. Shave with the grain, not against it. Don't go over the same area more than twice. Don't stretch out your skin while shaving; let is stay neutral and relaxed. Stretching your skin while yoyou shave increases the chance that the hair will 'snap back' to below skin level. Replace your blade regularly.

Zero grams of carb in that diet gelatin, so one can have all they want. Zero sugar or carbs in whipped cream, when sweetened with Splenda or another artificial sweetner. Yoyou can have all yoyou want and not blow your sugar. I stay entirely away from white flour 'cause it goes to sugar in the blood stream faster than sugar. Ditto for rice and pastas, breads. The glycemic index -- a chart that tells how fast any food goes to sugar can be helpful. I've posted the links below. That way yoyou can pick and choose the foods yoyou like and know how much yoyou can have of them. As long as yoyou stay with foods that are rated 55 and below, yoyou won't be hungry and won't raise your blood sugar. If yoyou learn to read the labels and look for those carbohydrates. Yoyou may be pleasantly surprised at what yoyou can eat -- and also how much hidden sugar is in other foods one would think were safe. Occasionally I have a piece of chocolate. If I take only a couple of squares, it's 7 grams of sugar. Not enough to raise blood sugar. If I instead have one of those fruit stirred yogurts, it might contain as much as 46 grams of sugar. Chocolate? Yogurt? One could eat the whole candy bar and not get as much sugar as in one of those little \"lite\" diet yogurts filled with sugar. I have made low carb cheesecake with NO sugar. Those I served it to didn't know, couldn't tell the difference between mine and Lindy's or any other cheesecake. Splenda bakes up just like sugar and tastes the same -- no aftertaste. So experiment with recipes for sweets and substitute something other than sugar. I have found the best success by making my own diet of foods I like, but watching the carbs. Especially the refined ones -- like while flour, sugar (watermelon and other sweet fruits, corn, carrots, even beets) , starches (potatoes, rice). I eliminated them. And, most importantly have breakfast in the morning. That will start your metabolism going. If yoyou can make it a high protein one, like eggs, meat, milk, plain yogurt, a piece of fruit -- all low carb choices, yoyou will find yoyou won't get hungry and crave sweets and your metabolism will start to burn and stay at a slow, steady burn all morning. There are sugar free diet puddings, one can make whipped cream with Splenda or Nutra Sweet, have a piece of fruit (apple), peanut butter on a slice of apple, an occasional piece of candy (just don't eat the whole bag or box at one sitting), and not feel deprived. Watch your blood sugar, and that will be your guide to what yoyou can eat and how foods affect you. With diabetes one's metabolism of sugars plays havoc with our appetite and our energy level. The secret is keeping one's blood sugar level -- not allowing it to rise fast,which taking in a lot of sugar does to us, and then crashes leaving us hungry and tired. Proteins digest slowly and release energy slowly,but consistently. Proteins and fats satisfy our hunger for a longer time. So adjusting your diet to eliminate the foods that raise blood sugar rapidly like the refined carbohydrates and sweets and replacing them with proteins and fiber, will actually reduce and maybe eliminate your craving for sweets Good luck and yoyou can write me if yoyou wish more links and info. rubysnowdragon@yahoo.com",

Brain cells then die by the millions. The notion that yoyou become brain damaged by using marijuana or opiates is a bit misleading. The balance of normal brain chemicals is altered, maybe forever, but they are still not killing brain cells. Cocaine is another drug commonly used. It effects the brain chemistry also, but is more damaging to the heart. It kills heart cells on contact in laboratory experiments. It may also be harmful due to the powerful solvents it contains as a residue leftover from its manufacturing process. If yoyou are going to use these substances yoyou should at least inform yourself as to the damage you're doing to your body.",
            "substances which \"kill\" your brains cells activate a part of your brain which produces euphoria. This is \"feeling good\". In using these substances, your brain becomes lazy and doesn't produce it's own euphoric enzymes which make us \"happy\". In the case of ethanol or \"alcoholic beverages\" it is a poison which anesthetizes cells of many body organs and depletes the oxygen in the bloodstream which keeps the cells alive and functioning. ...and it does feel bad when yoyou sober up and stop using the chemicals because your body is telling yoyou what yoyou did to it.",
            "When your body is under a physical attack (like drinking or smoking) or has had a serious injury (broken arm, dislocated joint) your body goes in to protection mode. This means that your body does not let your brain register the pain, for a while, so that yoyou are able to remain calm enough to figure out what's wrong with your body and what do to about it. SO in the sence of killing your brain cells, though highly not reccomended as yoyou only have a limited supply, it feels good because your body is trying to defend itself against you."

        "labelled_summary": "Contrary to popular belief, many substances thought to kill brain cells actually alter brain chemistry without necessarily causing cell death. The historical stigma surrounding drugs has contributed to misconceptions, as most substances were originally used as medicine. While certain widely used drugs, notably alcohol, can cause real damage to the brain, inhalants pose the quickest threat by introducing harmful compounds into the bloodstream, robbing the brain of essential oxygen and leading to rapid cell death. Although marijuana, opiates, and cocaine alter brain chemistry, they may not necessarily kill brain cells, but their misuse can have lasting effects on the balance of normal brain chemicals. Substances that are believed to \"kill\" brain cells activate brain regions associated with euphoria, leading to a dependence on external sources for pleasure. Ethanol, found in alcoholic beverages, acts as a poison, anesthetizing cells and depleting oxygen in the bloodstream, impacting overall cell function. Despite the temporary euphoric effects, the body's protective response during substance use can contribute to the illusion of well-being while potentially causing long-term harm."

            "I don't know.",
            "The only reliable unfortified sources of vitamin B12 are meat, dairy products and eggs. There has been considerable research into possible plant food sources of B12. Fermented soya products, seaweeds and algae have all been proposed as possible sources of B12. However, analysis of fermented soya products, including tempeh, miso, shoyyou and tamari, found no significant B12. Spirulina, an algae available as a dietary supplement in tablet form, and nori, a seaweed, have both appeared to contain significant amounts of B12 after analysis. However, it is thought that this is due to the presence of compounds structurally similar to B12, known as B12 analogues. These cannot be utilised to satisfy dietary needs. Assay methods used to detect B12 are unable to differentiate between B12 and it's analogues, Analysis of possible B12 sources may give false positive results due to the presence of these analogues. Researchers have suggested that supposed B12 supplements such as spirulina may in fact increase the risk of B12 deficiency disease, as the B12 analogues can compete with B12 and inhibit metabolism. The current nutritional consensus is that no plant foods can be relied on as a safe source of vitamin B12. Bacteria present in the large intestine are able to synthesise B12. In the past, it has been thought that the B12 produced by these colonic bacteria could be absorbed and utilised by humans. However, the bacteria produce B12 too far down the intestine for absorption to occur, B12 not being absorbed through the colon lining. Human faeces can contain significant B12. A study has shown that a group of Iranian vegans obtained adequate B12 from unwashed vegetables which had been fertilised with human manure. Faecal contamination of vegetables and other plant foods can make a significant contribution to dietary needs, particularly in areas where hygiene standards may be low. This may be responsible for the lack of aneamia due to B12 deficiency in vegan communities in developing countries. Good sources of vitamin B12 for vegetarians are dairy products or free-range eggs. \u00bd pint of milk (full fat or semi skimmed) contains 1.2 \u00b5g. A slice of vegetarian cheddar cheese (40g) contains 0.5 \u00b5g. A boiled egg contains 0.7 \u00b5g. Fermentation in the manufacture of yoghurt destroys much of the B12 present. Boiling milk can also destroy much of the B12. Vegans are recommended to ensure their diet includes foods fortified with vitamin B12. A range of B12 fortified foods are available. These include yeast extracts, Vecon vegetable stock, veggieburger mixes, textured vegetable protein, soya milks, vegetable and sunflower margarines, and breakfast cereals."

        "labelled_summary": "Reliable sources of vitamin B12 are limited to animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs, as well as bacteria in the large intestine. Plant-based options such as fermented soya products and algae are not dependable for B12. Some supplements like spirulina may even pose a risk of deficiency, as their analogues can hinder B12 metabolism. In conclusion, the consensus is that no plant foods can be considered a safe and reliable source of vitamin B12."

The exact clinical conditions that define abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are controversial; however, organ dysfunction caused by intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is considered to be ACS. The dysfunction may be respiratory insufficiency secondary to compromised tidal volumes, decreased urine output caused by falling renal perfusion, or any organ dysfunction associated with impaired perfusion.",

Crystalloid resuscitation, capillary leakage due to activated inflammatory mediators and reperfusion injury all contribute to this tissue swelling.

            "Small and out-of-sight, but painful, persistent and annoying. That's what canker sores, also called aphthous ulcers (aphthae), are like for people who experience them. These shallow ulcers in your mouth can make eating and talking uncomfortable. They may occur on your tongue, on your soft palate, inside your cheeks or lips, and at the base of your gums. The cause of most canker sores remains a mystery. IT IS NOT CAUSED BY HERPES (Cold sores are caused by Herpes). Researchers generally believe that stress or tissue injury may cause the eruption of canker sores. A minor injury, such as biting the inside of your mouth, may trigger a canker sore. Other causes may include: *Faulty immune system function *Nutritional problems such as a deficiency of vitamin B-12, zinc, folic acid or iron *A disease of the gastrointestinal tract *Food allergies *Menstrual periods Though anyone can get cankers sores, they tend to run in families and may be an inheritable condition.

            "No one is certain what causes canker sores. They often first appear between the ages of 10 and 20, although they can occur at any time in a person's life. One thing that doctors have noticed is that although the sores are not contagious, they can run in families. That means if your parents or siblings get canker sores, the genes yoyou share with them make it more likely that you'll develop the sores, too. There may be a connection between canker sores and stress. If the sores show up around exam time or some other big event in your life, it may be a sign of how much stress you're under. In addition, about twice as many women as men get them. Doctors think that may be due to the difference in male and female hormones, especially because women often get them during certain times in their menstrual cycle. Dietary deficiencies, such as not getting enough iron or vitamin B12, may also contribute to some cases of canker sores.",

While canker sores are not contagious, there is a familial tendency, suggesting a genetic component that increases the likelihood of developing them if family members also experience these sores. Stress has been proposed as a potential trigger, as the onset of canker sores sometimes coincides with periods of heightened stress, such as exams or significant life events. Women are more prone to canker sores than men, and hormonal differences, especially during specific phases of the menstrual cycle, may contribute to this discrepancy. Additionally, dietary deficiencies, such as insufficient iron or vitamin B12, are considered possible factors in certain cases of canker sores. In individuals with lupus, mouth and nose sores are common, although the specific cause of canker sores hasn't been definitively determined."

        "question": "Can black licorice candy cause heart problems?",
        "answers": [
            "The high blood pressure associated with true black licorice is liked to a chemical called glycyrrhizin, which comes from the licorice plant (Glycyrrhiza glabra). Once in the body and transformed into glycyrrhizic acid, this chemical inhibits the enzyme (11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) that converts cortisol to cortisone. Cortisol can bind to the same receptors that aldosterone can (they are both steroid hormones). So ultimately, the intake of glycyrrhizin leads to the body believing it has a higher level of aldosterone in the body. This subsequently leads to water and sodium retention, higher blood volume, and therefore, higher blood pressure. According to Hershey's webiste, Twizzlers (a product of Hershey's) is actually made to taste like black licorice, but does not contain either glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhizic acid. Now, it may contain other ingredients that can still increase blood pressure (sugar in general can increase blood pressure but usually by smaller amounts) but it will not fake out the body that aldosterone levels are high. The only sure-fire way to know if true licorice extract (and therefore glycyrrhizin) is inside the candy is to read the label or contact the manufacturer. If it's made with licorice extract or \"made from licorice root\", stay away (if yoyou have high blood pressure). Otherwise, enjoy!",

I don't think there is anyway to really tell how much of the hormone like aldosterone is in the licorice As for the Twizzlers they might actually be the best brand if yoyou have to have an occasional piece of licorice, because if yoyou have ever had that and then some of the gourmet and natural licorices yoyou will know what I mean that the Twizzlers is rather mild. I am not saying safe just that it is milder."

            "The basics of most nutrition books Don\u2019t starve yourself. That\u2019s the worst thing yoyou can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since, fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition[not the healthiest though]. The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer. Before I continue let me explain protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Protein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken, fish, sirloin, and milk. Carbohydrates [carbs] can be found almost in anything else even apples. Good carbs: Apples, wheat bread, sourdough bread, grains, and wheat Bad carbs: White bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, Doritos, and sodas! Good fats: Avocados, pecans, almonds, and peanut butter The ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like [50%Protien:40%Carbs:10%fat] This can sound meaningless. So in plain terms consume only good fats [portioned] and yoyou should be okay. Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately. not consecutively]. The reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because yoyou are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories] so theoretically if yoyou eat less fats and more proteins yoyou will have a less appetite because yoyou will eat more. Another nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself. That\u2019s how the Adkins basically works. If yoyou consume more proteins and less carbs yoyou will lose weight. I leave to yoyou to decide if this is good you. I would also advice yoyou to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because yoyou are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that yoyou will eat in 3 hour and yoyou will quickly noticed that yoyou will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry] if yoyou do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla. Yoyou are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if yoyou have been starving yourself or if yoyou don\u2019t exercise].",

One effective approach is to recognize that the stomach takes about 20 minutes to signal fullness to the brain. Increasing water intake is recommended to expedite the feeling of fullness, helping to reduce overall appetite. The message cautions against starvation, highlighting its negative impact on metabolism and the body's tendency to store more fat. A balanced diet is emphasized, distinguishing between good and bad carbohydrates and fats. The importance of incorporating proteins, such as those from animal sources, and opting for good fats like avocados and nuts is stressed. The suggested dietary ratio is approximately 50% protein, 40% carbohydrates, and 10% fat, with the goal of consuming fewer fats and more proteins to decrease appetite and facilitate weight loss. The Atkins diet is briefly mentioned as an example of a low-carb approach to weight management."

Fainting is actually a valuable self protective response.When blood pressure drops this way, there is a chance the brain won't get enough blood, because it's at the highest point of the body. That's no good - your brain needs a steady supply of the oxygen the blood carries. So when your body can't get enough blood to your brain because of low blood pressure, it protects yoyou by bringing your brain down to the blood. In other words, the purpose of a faint is to ensure a blood supply to the brain by bringing your head down to the ground, so your heart doesn't have to overcome gravity.",
            "vasovagal syncope, this is the common faint associated with a stress response of the autonomic nervous system which can either suddenly lower the pulse rate, the blood pressure or both together. It is one of the neurally-mediated reflex syncopes. Fainting or syncope is a sudden (and generally momentary) loss of consciousness due to a lack of sufficient blood and oxygen reaching the brain. The first symptoms a person feels before fainting are dizziness and feeling hot. Moments later, the person's vision turns black and he or she drops to the floor (or slumps if seated in a chair). Factors that influence fainting are taking in too little food and fluids, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, physical exercise in excess of the energy reserve of the body, and lack of sleep. Even standing up too quickly or being in too hot a room can cause fainting. Fainting involves a temporary reduction of blood (and therefore oxygen) supply to the brain, resulting in a blackout. Many forms of syncope are benign and easy to associate with clear precipitants that can be avoided. Such precipitants can include many common situations and recreational drugs as well as therapeutic drugs."

What's less obvious is that it's the most important organ that controls the composition of the body fluids. In addition, it does produce a number of hormones that deal with body function. The kidney is a filtering organ, so blood is delivered to a very unique apparatus in the kidney called the glomerulus, and there, because of pressure dynamics, a component of the blood is filtered across the membrane, and the first process of creating the urine develops. In this segment of the kidney, in the glomerulus, the composition of that fluid is very similar to blood. The fluid passes through a series of tubules in a structure called the nephron, and there it's modified, heavily modified. A variety of things are reabsorbed that we need, and a variety of toxins are concentrated until the end of the kidney, the end of that nephron segment, drains into something called a papilla, then into the ureter, and then the bladder, and we have what we term \"urine,\" which is a fluid rich in toxic wastes that is excreted. suppose yoyou drink a bottle of orange juice. The body sees a sudden excess of an element called potassium, so the kidney has sensors which look at the body fluid going through the kidney as plasma, and it detects that the plasma's potassium has gone up, and it immediately increase the excretion of potassium so everything comes back to normal.",

The assistance ends the life of a person or an animal, in a painless or minimally painful way. Euthanasia is most often performed in a merciful way, in order to end suffering. This article discusses euthanasia in humans; a separate article covers animal euthanasia. This topic is often highly-charged\u2014emotionally, politically, and morally. Terminology and laws shift over time and geographically and globally, causing a great deal of confusion. Firstly there is some debate as to whether euthanasia refers to \"letting die\" or \"allowing to die.\" (See terms: informed consent, decisional capacity, surrogate decision making, Living wills, Do Not Resuscitate) In the United States and the Netherlands, \"letting die\" or \"allowing to die\" refer to areas which the state consider ethically and legally acceptable and permissible. This includes the withholding and withdrawing of medical treatment such as dialysis or feeding tubes or hydration and nutrition. The last two being things which are associated with \"love and caring\" in most cultures. While the concept of holding off on those two things may be counterintuitive, as a body's major organ systems try to shut down, a dying person often feels most comfortable without any fluids or food. To do otherwise is like \"force feeding\" a body that does not \"want\" or need to be fed or hydrated, and doing so may actually cause physical discomfort and suffering. In the UK this is usually only accepted when a newly born baby is born with certain physical or mental disorders. In most other countries removing or denying treatment would usually be seen as murder. Usually, because in a growing number of law cases over the last 20 years, the jury has sided with the defendant. Next are several summary statements defining what euthanasia can include,. These are followed by expanded definitions of each. Euthanasia (assisted dying) may employ methods that are either indirect or direct. Indirect methods of euthanasia are defined by a individual him or herself taking the final step inducing death. Direct methods are defined by the involvement of others (clinicians) who take the final step inducing death. Direct euthanasia can either be voluntary, nonvoluntary or involuntary. (See Karl Binding and Alfred Hoche for one of the first uses of the three types of euthanasia.) Indirect euthanasia involves the indirect involvement of a clinician (e.g. physician, clinical nurse practitioner, pharmacist) as an agent who participates only by providing the means for a patient to induce his/her own death. This could mean writing or filling a prescription for medications in a quantity large enough to cause death when taken by the patient. This kind of assistance is currently legal in the American state of Oregon. It became legal in 1998 as a result of the \"Death with Dignity Act\" which was passed in the state in 1994. In politically and emotionally loaded terms, this is frequently referred to as physician-assisted suicide. Direct euthanasia involves the direct involvement of a clinician as agent in inducing a patient\u2019s death. (e.g. administering a lethal drug by injection.) Direct euthanasia is not currently legal anywhere in the US, but both direct and indirect euthanasia are legal in Belgium and the Netherlands. Voluntary euthanasia occurs with the fully-informed request of a decisionally-competent adult patient or that of their surrogate (proxy). (Example: Thomas Youk, with ALS was assisted by Jack Kevorkian.) A large part of the controversy surrounding euthanasia focuses upon the slippery slope argument. The fear is that indirect euthanasia and/or voluntary direct euthanasia will lead to acceptance of the nonvoluntary and involuntary types of euthanasia. Nonvoluntary euthanasia",

There is a debate on whether euthanasia refers to \"letting die\" or \"allowing to die,\" with distinctions in ethical and legal considerations. In some regions, including the United States and the Netherlands, \"letting die\" is ethically acceptable, encompassing the withholding or withdrawing of medical treatments. In the UK, this is usually accepted for newborns with certain disorders, while in other countries, it may be perceived as murder.

I said, do I want to have a cold on top of that. No siree. I mean, yoyou really have to talk to your NEURO, and what (s)he recommends. It just so happened that the first NEURO in 1999, recommended Avonex as he was drinking out of an Avonex branded mug (no foolin!). That is what turned me off from the med idea in the first place. My SECOND neuro, he asked me my concerns, and we decided on Copaxone. Yes, it's daily, but it's under the skin, and it just has local reactions for me as a side effect. I WAS PETRIFIED of giving myself these shots. Many of the companies (my drugs, included) have autojectors, so yoyou don't even have to see the needle. Copaxone (or my doctor, I can't remember, it was so long ago!)... required me to have a home care nurse there the first time to show me how to administer the drugs. I gave it to myself without hesitation the first time! I am a little wary of someone else doing it (though she had recommended that my fiance learn how, too). Result? Well, there's not much to say! (that's a good thing)... my original symptoms had faded, and I don't know if that was the copaxone or what. I've been on it since 2/2004 (wow! going on 2 years soon!), and I have NO NEW LESIONS! boy, that's more exciting than I thought it was going to be. Now, your milage WILL vary, and unlike my first time experience, yoyou will LIKELY have to go through a few drugs to find one yoyou like. Good luck to you!",

These drugs aim to modify the immune system's activity, addressing the autoimmune nature of MS, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin coating around nerve fibers. Although not a cure, they have the potential to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, especially in relapsing-remitting MS. Betaseron and Novantrone may also slow down disease progression in some cases of secondary progressive MS. Personal experiences with interferons and Glatiramer acetate are shared, along with the suggestion that dietary factors might influence MS symptoms.

I used to have it pretty badly and what has warmed my hands and feet considerably is taking once daily ONE 100-mg Dilantin capsule (phenytoin sodium). Dilantin is a long-established, anti-seizure drug that has many other uses, too. It works by balancing the sodium/potassium pump at the cellular level. In low doses it is a very safe mood regulator, even long-term indefinitely - and this is why I started taking it (I do not have seizures of any kind). For me Dilantin works better than any antidepressant I ever tried (and I'd been prescribed several), with no weight gain, and also Dilantin has made me need less sleep than previously. That it warmed my hands and feet, too, was an unlooked-for-but-VERY-welcome side benefit. For a good read and good info on low-dose Dilantin's many uses please read, \"A Remarkable Medicine Has Been Overlooked\" by Jack Dreyfus (ISBN 0-8264-1069-3). Dilantin is the only med I take regularly now (I hate most meds), and I've taken it entirely voluntarily since May 1998. It definitely has changed my life for the better.

        "question": "Why is my hair falling out?",
        "answers": [
            "Causes of Excessive Hair Loss The rate of hair shedding in androgenic alopecia is speeded up by three forces: advancing age, an inherited tendency to bald early, and an over-abundance of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) within the hair follicle. DHT is a highly active form of testosterone, which influences many aspects of manly behavior, from sex drive to aggression. The conversion from testosterone to DHT is driven by an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase, which is produced in the prostate, various adrenal glands, and the scalp. Over time, the action of DHT causes the hair follicle to degrade and shortens the anagen phase. Thought the follicle is technically still alive and connected to a good blood supply--it can successfully nurture a transplanted follicle which is immune to the effects of DHT--it will grow smaller and smaller (figure 3). Some follicles will gradually die, but most will simply shrink to the size they were when yoyou were born which produce weaker hairs. With a steadily shorter anagen growing cycle, more hairs are shed, the hairs becoming thinner and thinner until they are too fine to survive daily wear and tear. Balding hair gradually changes from long, thick, coarse, pigmented hair into fine, unpigmented vellus sprouts. However, the sebaceous gland attached to it remains the same size. As the hair shafts become smaller, the gland continues to pump out about the same amount of oil. So as your hair thins, yoyou will notice that your hair becomes flatter and oilier. But the hormonal link in balding is complex. Eunuchs, who produce no testosterone, never go bald -- even if carrying a baldness gene. However, if castrated men with a family history of baldness are given testosterone, they lose hair in the classic horseshoe-shaped pattern. Studies show that while balding men don't have higher than average circulating testosterone levels, they do possess above-average amounts of a powerful testosterone derivative, dihydrotestosterone in the scalp follicles. In male balding, genetically primed follicles convert circulating testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which successively diminishes or miniaturizes follicle size, producing ever weaker hairs. With a steadily shorter anagen growing cycle, more hairs are shed, the hairs becoming thinner and thinner until they are too fine to survive daily wear and tear. Balding hair gradually changes from long, thick, coarse, pigmented hair into fine, depigmented vellus sprouts. Other physiological factors might cause hair loss. Recently, a group of Japanese researcher reported a correlation between excessive sebum in the scalp and hair loss. Excessive sebum often accompanying thinning hair is attributed to an enlargement of the sebaceous gland. They believed excessive sebum causes an high level of 5-alpha reductase and pore clogging, thus malnutrition of the hair root. Although this condition could be hereditary, they believe diet is a more prominent cause. The researchers note that Japanese hair was thick and healthy, with a small gland and little scalp oil, until the occidental habit of consuming animal fat crept into their diet after World War II. This change has led to a significant height increase in the Japanese population, but it has also resulted in more Japanese men losing hair. To some extent, their observation makes sense since problems with greasy hair have often been noted as much as six months to a year prior to when thinning hair becomes noticeable, but this might be just one of the symptoms, not underlying cause, more research is needed. Most doctors agree that if yoyou have a oily scalp with thinning hair, frequent shampooing is advised. shampooing can reduce surface sebum, which contains high levels of testosterone and DHT that may reenter the skin and affect the hair follicle.",

        "labelled_summary": "Excessive hair loss, particularly in androgenic alopecia, is influenced by multiple factors. These include advancing age, a genetic predisposition to early balding, and an overproduction of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent form of testosterone, within the hair follicles. The conversion of testosterone to DHT, facilitated by the enzyme 5-alpha reductase in various glands including the scalp, leads to the degradation of the hair follicle and shortens the anagen (growth) phase. Despite the follicle being alive, it gradually shrinks, producing finer hairs that are prone to shedding. The hormonal complexity of balding is evident, with castrated men, devoid of testosterone, remaining unaffected by baldness genes, while castrated men with a genetic predisposition to baldness, upon receiving testosterone, experience hair loss in a classic pattern. Studies indicate that balding men possess higher levels of DHT in scalp follicles. Apart from hormonal factors, excessive sebum in the scalp has been linked to hair loss, with a potential correlation to an enlarged sebaceous gland. While this condition could be hereditary, diet is also considered a significant factor, as observed in the Japanese population post-World War II. The change in diet, incorporating more animal fat, led to increased scalp oil and hair loss. Additionally, during pregnancy, hormonal changes can cause accelerated hair growth, followed by postpartum hair shedding as hormone levels return to normal."

The current state of the Canadian system is strained, with long wait times for doctor appointments and challenges in maintaining funding. While people in Canada may seek treatment in the US at times, the Canadian system historically treated everyone equally, in contrast to the US system, which prioritizes those with more financial means. Despite comparable technology, facilities, and doctor training, the differences lie in accessibility and prioritization based on financial status in the US."

I checked out the barn (which I hadn't had much to do with before now) and thought about how it would best work for horses. I checked out the fences. Hmmm.

It took a while but before too long, I was learning how to put up temporary fence, talking online with people about horses, then the telephone, then going out and looking at horses, and eventually purchasing a horse. Now I take several trips to the barn a day, spend time in the pasture and paddock with the horses, run to the feed store for feed and other supplies, spend time out fixing fence and weed whacking the weeds along the fence-line. I'm basically not a social person, but this has given me something that I enjoy that I have a reason to go outside my front door for.

Following this, a short nap of at least 20 minutes is advised, aiming to sustain alertness for the subsequent waking hours. The proposed sleep pattern further suggests a sequence of 6 hours awake, followed by a 1 to 2-hour sleep, and finally, a return to normal nighttime sleep for the remaining hours. It's important to recognize that this schedule is described as \"rough,\" acknowledging the variability of individual sleep needs and patterns.

Prolactin is made up of 199 amino acids, and has a molecular weight of about 23,000 daltons. Prolactin has many effects, the most significant of which is to stimulate the mammary glands to produce milk (lactation). Increased serum prolactin during pregnancy causes enlargement of the mammary glands of the breasts and increases the production of milk. However, the high levels of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy acts directly on the breasts to stop ejection of milk. It is only when the levels of these hormones fall after child birth that milk ejection is possible. Sometimes, newborn babies (males as well as females) secrete a milky substance from their nipples. This substance is called Witch's milk. This is caused by the fetus' being affected by prolactin circulating in the mother just before birth, and usually stops soon after birth",

            "Medical uses The extract of the Ginkgo leaves contains flavonoid glycosides and ginkgolides and has been used pharmaceutically. It has many alleged properties, but is mainly used as memory enhancer and anti-vertigo agent. However, studies differ about its efficacy. It is commonly added to energy drinks, but it is expensive, so the amount is typically so low it does not produce a noticeable effect, except for the placebo effect from being listed on the label. A study published in the August 21, 2002 issue of Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) suggests that there is no difference between the memory abilities of people taking ginkgo supplements and those taking a placebo. Side effects Ginkgo may have some undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anti-coagulants such as aspirin and warfarin, although recent studies have found that ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin[1][2]. It should also not be used by people who are taking the anti-depressant drugs known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or by pregnant women. Ginkgo side effects and cautions include increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and restlessness. Ginkgo should also not be used by pregnant women or people with a blood clotting disorder. If any side effects are experienced the dosage should be lowered immediately. Ginkgo supplements are usually taken in the range of 40-200 mg per day. If the side effects continue usage should be stopped completely. Tinnitus: Treatment Some types of tinnitus can be treated while others are permanent. In general, there are no cures specific to tinnitus, but if it is caused by a physical condition that can be treated, the tinnitus may also resolve. Chronic tinnitus can be quite stressful psychologically as it distracts the affected individual from mental tasks and interferes with sleep, particularly when there is no external sound. The affected individual may have to generate artificial noise that masks the tinnitus sound. A combination of external masking and psychological counseling known as tinnitus retraining therapy is widely practiced. While it does not actually cure the tinnitus, many report that it becomes much less disturbing and easier to ignore.",
            "According to research, gingko is particularly useful for circulatory problems because it works to regulate the tone and elasticity of blood vessels, increasing blood flow to the brain and extremities. Gingko also delivers a boost to the nervous system by stimulating the transmission of extra oxygen and glucose to blood cells. Additionally, gingko performs as a powerful antioxidant by scavenging harmful free radicals and aiding in the maintenance of cells. Gingko biloba can help to relieve depression, headaches, anxiety, tinnitus, and dizziness, while promoting both memory and mental clarity. Controlled studies have shown gingko, which stimulates blood flow to the brain, can improve memory in some people with Alzheimer's disease. It can also be useful in the treatment of symptoms from such conditions as Raynaud's disease, macular degeneration, cataracts, impotence, and asthma. Furthermore, gingko is beneficial in the treatment of complications of diabetes, and helps to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.

        "answers": [
            "The word \"bipolar\" is simply a label used to categorise a list of psychosocial traits that Psychiatry considers to be improper or abnormal in society. Psychiatry defines these traits as a \"mental illness\", and promotes it as a \"disease\" that requires \"treatment\". It is not a \"disease\", despite claims or implications made by certain psychiatric or pharmaceutical organisations. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes \"bipolar\" as a biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or \"chemical imbalance\". \"For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign.\" Fred Baughman, MD., Neurologist & Pediatric Neurologist. \"Chemical imbalance\u2026it\u2019s a shorthand term really, it\u2019s probably drug industry derived\u2026 We don\u2019t have tests because to do it, you\u2019d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea.\" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005. Symptoms that psychiatry labels as \"bipolar\" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people, for example, have overcome \"bipolar\" through megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including symptoms labelled as \"schizophrenia\" [See source refs] Bottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a \"faith\", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called \"research\" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.

            "This is a personal decision, but for me the answer to managing my bipolar is meds and therapy. After going on and off for about 2 1/2 years, and dealing with serious consequences, I finally accepted that to have the quality of life I want, I HAVE to take the drugs EVERY DAY for the rest of my life. I've been on them permanently for about 3 1/2 years now. It took a long time to adjust to being so different. At times, I feel like I've lost a bit of my identity, but the positives outweigh that. In a way, I'm MORE myself b/c I can follow through with things that are important to me and I can respect myself more for being true to who I am. When I wasn't managing the bipolar well, I'd do things that weren't \"me\" if I got too up or down. But it did take a long time on the meds to feel like this new me is the real me. I miss some of the highs, b/c I was so creative and productive. But the depressions would always undo any progress I made when up, so overall I didn't move forward with the things that are important to me. So even though the slow and steady pace I work at now seems boring, I take comfort in realizing that in the scheme of things, I'm accomplishing more."

The argument maintains that for a disease to exist, there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality, and psychiatry lacks such tests.

The message suggests that symptoms labeled as \"bipolar\" can stem from various sources, and some have overcome it through megavitamin therapy and nutrition.

            "The doctors are right. I developed one on my shin after a wreck. 6 months later it was flat and only minorly discolored, 8 months later it was no longer painful to the touch and the coloration had gone, 10 months later it no longer hurt to run. It does take a while, I would wait as long as yoyou can to decide to get it drained, because I was told this can be painful. But if there's absolutely no change in color or size after 7 months, yoyou may want to go for it, cause that's about when the calcification process starts (Eventually it will turn hard.) Healing time also depends on where the hematoma is located. If there is mostly bone and not alot of muscle mass, it may not take as long (i.e. top of foot, hand, etc.) In areas with much muscle mass and fat, it may take a long time, because the muscle absorbs all the protein. Here's what yoyou can do to hurry it a little: Fill a styrofoam cup with water and freeze. Tear the top rim off so a half inch or so protrudes like chapstick. Massage the hematoma lightly with this ice for 15 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times daily. At night, use some form of localized heat, that can be comfortable and not dangerous or painfull. This will help promote bloodflow in that area. DON'T rub or massage the area, yoyou may make the area bleed again under the skin, starting yoyou back at day 1. Eat a diet rich in protein. Get extra rest if the hematoma is on your legs or feet. Good luck, I hope this helps you."

            "yes there is, and it's called cupping and it's the most oldest traditional medicine. and the most amazing thing that most latest studies have beeen shown that it releive migarains by 80%>>>>>> How does cupping work? What does it treat? In a typical cupping session, glass cups are warmed using a cotton ball or other flammable substance, which is soaked in alcohol, let, then placed inside the cup. Burning a substance inside the cup removes all the oxygen, which creates a vacuum. As the substance burns, the cup is turned upside-down so that the practitioner can place the cup over a specific area. The vacuum created by the lack of oxygen anchors the cup to the skin and pulls it upward on the inside of the glass as the air inside the jar cools. Drawing up the skin is believed to open up the skin\u2019s pores, which helps to stimulate the flow of blood, balances and realigns the flow of qi, breaks up obstructions, and creates an avenue for toxins to be drawn out of the body. Depending on the condition being treated, the cups will be left in place from 5 to 10 minutes. Several cups may be placed on a patient\u2019s body at the same time. Some practitioners will also apply small amounts of medicated oils or herbal oils to the skin just before the cupping procedure, which lets them move the cups up and down particular acupoints or meridians after they have been applied. In China, cupping is used primarily to treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis, asthma, and congestion; arthritis; gastrointestinal disorders; and certain types of pain. Some practitioners also use cupping to treat depression and reduce swelling. Fleshy sites on the body, such as the back and stomach (and, to a lesser extent, the arms and legs), are the preferred sites for treatment. How many types of cupping are there? In addition to the traditional form of cupping described above, which is known as \u201cdry\u201d cupping, some practitioners also use what is called \u201cwet\u201d or \u201cair\u201d cupping. In \u201cair\u201d cupping, instead of using a flame to heat the cup, the cup is applied to the skin, and a suction pump is attached to the rounded end of the jar. The pump is then used to create the vacuum. In \u201cwet\u201d cupping, the skin is punctured before treatment. When the cup is applied and the skin is drawn up, a small amount of blood may flow from the puncture site, which are believed to help remove harmful substances and toxins from the body. Is cupping safe? Does it hurt? While cupping is considered relatively safe (especially air cupping, which does not include the risk of fire and heat), it can cause some swelling and bruising on the skin. As the skin under a cup is drawn up, the blood vessels at the surface of the skin expand. This may result in small, circular bruises on the areas where the cups were applied. These bruises are usually painless, however, and disappear within a few days of treatment. In addition, there are several instances where cupping should not be performed. Patients with inflamed skin; cases of high fever or convulsions; and patients who bleed easily, are not suitable candidates for cupping. Pregnant women should not have cupping on their stomach or lower back. If the cups are being moved, they should not cross bony areas, such as the ridges of the spine or the shoulder blades.

If the mood is irritable, four additional symptoms must be present.",
            "FAQ: Bipolar Disorder... 1. What is bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder is a common, recurrent, severe psychiatric illness that affects an individual's mood, behavior and ability to think clearly. It occurs in 1% to 2% of the population in the United States. A variant, called bipolar II disorder, is probably even more common and occurs in up to 3% of the general population in this country. 2. What are the differences between bipolar I and bipolar II disorders? Bipolar I disorder is characterized by episodes of mania that alternate with periods of depression or periods in which individuals have simultaneously occurring manic and depressive symptoms called mixed states. In contrast, bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and milder symptoms of mania, called hypomania. Hypomanic episodes typically do not impair an individual's ability to function to the extent that full-blown manic episodes do additionally; hypomanic episodes are not complicated by psychotic symptoms. 3. What is rapid cycling? The term rapid cycling was originally coined by David Dunner, M.D., and Ron Fieve, M.D., in the 1970s when they identified a group of individuals who did not respond well to lithium. These patients typically had four or more episodes of mania or depression in the 12-month interval prior to lithium treatment. This definition has been adopted formally by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.) and specifically means the occurrence of four or more mood episodes within the preceding year. In severe cases, rapid cycling can occur even within a one-day period. 4. At what age does bipolar disorder appear? Bipolar disorder most commonly presents in the late teens and early 20s. Unfortunately, for most individuals, lifelong treatment may be required to prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Equally unfortunate is evidence that the illness often goes undiagnosed and untreated for many years; the longer the illness progresses without treatment, the greater the impairment in an individual's psychological, educational and vocational development. Additionally, untreated bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. 5. Is bipolar disorder genetic? Bipolar disorder, among all psychiatric illnesses, may have the greatest genetic contribution. For instance, if an individual has a parent with bipolar disorder, the chance that the individual's child will have bipolar disorder is about nine-fold greater than in the general population, with the risk rising from about 1% to about 10%. The inheritability of this illness is estimated to be anywhere from 50% to 80%. On the other hand, if a person with bipolar disorder is thinking about having children, there are still good odds that the child will not have bipolar illness. So the genetic determinants of the illness are complicated. 6. How is bipolar disorder treated? The cornerstone of treatment is medications that treat acute manic, depressive or mixed episodes, and which, in the long run, attempt to prevent the recurrence of these episodes. Such medications include lithium, divalproex (Depakote) and, more recently, some of the atypical antipsychotics as well as antidepressants. Psychotherapy plays an important role in improving the course and outcome of this illness in people. In particular, those with bipolar disorder often have strained relationships with loved ones because of their experiences during manic or depressive episodes; psychotherapy can help repair these torn relationships. In addition, psychotherapy can educate people about the signs and symptoms of their illness, how to pay attention to warning signs and how to nip emerging episodes in the bud. Psychotherapy can also help individuals cope with the stress that can sometimes precipitate manic or depressive episodes. 7. What medications are used to treat bipolar disorder? There are a number of medicat",
            "Bipolar disorder manifests itself in numerous ways, most notably: Depression: symptoms include a persistent sad mood; loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed; significant changes in body weight; significant changes in appetite; difficulty sleeping or oversleeping; physical slowing or agitation; loss of energy; feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt; difficulty thinking or concentrating; recurrent thoughts of self-harm, death or suicide. (Some people are also diagnosed and treated for obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, and/or panic disorder.) Mania: Abnormally and persistently elevated (high) mood and/or irritability accompanied by at least three of the following symptoms (four if the mood is merely irritable): decreased need for sleep; increased talkativeness; racing thoughts; distractibility; increased goal-directed activity such as shopping, or other tasks carried on in an urgent manner; physical agitation; hypersexuality; excessive involvement in risky activities. The behavior may seem unusual to friends or family, while the person's level of insight may vary, and is higher among those with co-occuring conditions. According to the DSM-IV-TR (p. 345), the two principal forms of Bipolar disorder are: Bipolar I disorder, the diagnosis of which requires over the entire course of the individual's life at least one manic (or mixed) state episode which is usually (though not always) accompanied by major depressive episodes. Bipolar II disorder, which over the course of the individual's life must involve at least one major Depressive episode and must be accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. There must be no manic episodes. If there were manic episodes, the accurate diagnosis would be Bipolar I."

        "labelled_summary": "Bipolar disorder is a prevalent, recurrent, and severe psychiatric condition affecting mood, behavior, and cognitive functions. The disorder encompasses manic episodes marked by increased energy, euphoria, irritability, rapid thoughts, and poor judgment. Additional symptoms include distractibility, reduced need for sleep, and heightened sexual drive. A manic episode is diagnosed if these symptoms persist most of the day for at least one week. Bipolar I disorder involves manic episodes alternating with depressive periods, while bipolar II disorder features recurrent depression and milder hypomanic states. Rapid cycling, characterized by four or more mood episodes in a year, is a variant. Typically emerging in late teens or early 20s, bipolar disorder is often undiagnosed and untreated, posing risks to psychological, educational, and vocational development. Genetic factors contribute significantly, with heritability estimated between 50% and 80%. Treatment involves medications such as lithium and psychotherapy to manage acute episodes and prevent recurrences. Symptoms include depression's persistent sadness, changes in appetite and sleep, and thoughts of self-harm, while mania is characterized by elevated mood, decreased sleep, and impulsive behavior. Bipolar I disorder requires manic episodes with major depressive episodes, while Bipolar II involves major depressive and hypomanic episodes without full-blown mania. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to mitigate long-term impairment and suicide risk."

Although there is no cure, treatment can usually control symptoms and prevent the condition from getting worse. If yoyou have been diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, there are steps that yoyou can take at home to help reduce pain and stiffness and allow yoyou to continue daily activities. These steps include: Educating yourself. Learn all yoyou can about your condition and know what complications to watch for. This will help yoyou control your symptoms and stay more active. Reducing pain by taking pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or using heat to decrease your pain and stiffness. Warm showers or baths or sleeping under a warm electric blanket may reduce stiffness. Exercising regularly. This reduces pain and stiffness and helps maintain fitness and mobility of the spine, chest, and joints. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy to get yoyou started on an exercise program. Deep breathing exercises can improve or maintain lung capacity. Swimming as part of your exercise program helps to maintain chest expansion and movement of the spine without jarring the spine. Breast stroke is especially good for chest expansion. Yoyou should avoid contact sports, since joint fusion may make your spine more likely to fracture as the disease progresses, but your doctor may approve of other activities such as golf and tennis. Check with your doctor before yoyou add any new activity. Maintaining proper posture and chest expansion. Good posture is important because it can help prevent abnormal bending of the spine. Maintaining chest expansion will help prevent problems such as lung infection (pneumonia). It's a good idea to lie on your stomach a few times each day to keep your spine and hips extended. For sleeping, choose a firm mattress and a small pillow that supports your neck. Avoiding smoking, to prevent serious breathing difficulties and lung scarring. Lung damage from smoking, combined with decreased chest expansion and the lung infections that sometimes go with ankylosing spondylitis, can seriously limit your ability to breathe freely. Having regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist, to check for inflammation of the colored part of the eye (iritis). Joining a support group.

        "question": "Which antidepressant will not make me gain weight, and won't make me lose my libido?",
        "answers": [
            "Thats not a question that can be answered without the help of a psychiatrist. Its important to understand that different individuals react differently to the same medication. Somtimes the sexual side effects from an antidepressant are a good trade off with the overall benefits of the drug, sometimes not. \"Stop getting off\" is a choice :-). If your libido is comparatively low, yoyou might not feel like indulging in sexual activity a lot, unless stimulated. That again is a subjective thing. Some men are prescribed antidepressants for premature ejaculation because it helps them to slow down and retain an erection for a longer time. As far as weight is concerned, once yoyou are \"off your butt\" yoyou can do a lot to maintain that. Dont expect the antidepressant to be a wonder drug but something that helps yoyou \"for a while.\" There are different kind of antidepressants - 1. Tricyclic antidepressants (Elavil, Endep, Anafranil, Norpramin, Pertofrane, Adapin, Sinequan, Tofranil, Aventyl, Vivactil, Surmontil) 2. Tetracyclic antidepressants (Asendin, Ludiomil). 3. SSRI antidepressants: Celexa, Prozac, Luvox, Paxil, Zoloft. 4. MAO inhibitors (Marplan, Nardil, Eldepryl, Parnate) 5. Serotonin antagonists (Serzone, Desyrel) 6. Others (Wellbutrin, Effexor, Remeron) Mood stabilizers Tegretol, Neurontin, Lamictal, Eskalith, Depakene, Depakote. The most commonly used antidepressants are SSRIs with Prozac being considered almost a synonym for an antidepressant. Weight gain or loss and decreased or increased libido are not the only side effects of antidepressants. There are other potentially dangerous side effects like muscular spasms and lethal interactions with other drugs that it makes it imperative to seek psychiatric consultation before yoyou start on them. The best treatment is a combination of cognitive therapy with an antidepressant. Feeling Good by David D. Burns, M.D. is the Bible for depressed inviduals and psychiatrists themselves prescribe it to patients. So go grab it first. The latest version has a consumer guide for antidepressants as well.

It's crucial to consult with a psychiatrist before starting any medication, as side effects can include not only weight changes and libido issues but also muscular spasms and interactions with other drugs. Exercise is often recommended as it can boost energy, aid in weight management, and positively impact mood. Combining cognitive therapy with an antidepressant is a common and effective treatment strategy, and individual preferences and responses should guide the selection of medication."

Maintenance ECTs may follow at varying intervals depending on the patient's response. However, a downside is temporary confusion after receiving the shocks, with more shocks potentially leading to increased confusion. There's a misconception in the passage about ECT causing brain damage and significant memory loss; while confusion is a temporary side effect, severe and permanent damage is not supported by evidence. The passage suggests an alternative approach to depression through physical labor, advocating for activities like doing laundry to overcome depression.

            "Ulcerative colitis is a disease. There is no cure. There is, however, treatment options. Treatment for ulcerative colitis depends on the seriousness of the disease. Most people are treated with medication. In severe cases, a patient may need surgery to remove the diseased colon. Surgery is the only cure for ulcerative colitis. Some people whose symptoms are triggered by certain foods are able to control the symptoms by avoiding foods that upset their intestines, like highly seasoned foods, raw fruits and vegetables, or milk sugar (lactose). Each person may experience ulcerative colitis differently, so treatment is adjusted for each individual. Emotional and psychological support is important. Some people have remissions\u2014periods when the symptoms go away\u2014that last for months or even years. However, most patients' symptoms eventually return. This changing pattern of the disease means one cannot always tell when a treatment has helped. Some people with ulcerative colitis may need medical care for some time, with regular doctor visits to monitor the condition. Drug Therapy The goal of therapy is to induce and maintain remission, and to improve the quality of life for people with ulcerative colitis. Several types of drugs are available. Aminosalicylates, drugs that contain 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA), help control inflammation. Sulfasalazine is a combination of sulfapyridine and 5-ASA and is used to induce and maintain remission. The sulfapyridine component carries the anti-inflammatory 5-ASA to the intestine. However, sulfapyridine may lead to side effects such as include nausea, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea, and headache. Other 5-ASA agents such as olsalazine, mesalamine, and balsalazide, have a different carrier, offer fewer side effects, and may be used by people who cannot take sulfasalazine. 5-ASAs are given orally, through an enema, or in a suppository, depending on the location of the inflammation in the colon. Most people with mild or moderate ulcerative colitis are treated with this group of drugs first. Corticosteroids such as prednisone and hydrocortisone also reduce inflammation. They may be used by people who have moderate to severe ulcerative colitis or who do not respond to 5-ASA drugs. Corticosteroids, also known as steroids, can be given orally, intravenously, through an enema, or in a suppository, depending on the location of the inflammation. These drugs can cause side effects such as weight gain, acne, facial hair, hypertension, mood swings, and an increased risk of infection. For this reason, they are not recommended for long-term use. Immunomodulators such as azathioprine and 6-mercapto-purine (6-MP) reduce inflammation by affecting the immune system. They are used for patients who have not responded to 5-ASAs or corticosteroids or who are dependent on corticosteroids. However, immunomodulators are slow-acting and may take up to 6 months before the full benefit is seen. Patients taking these drugs are monitored for complications including pancreatitis and hepatitis, a reduced white blood cell count, and an increased risk of infection. Cyclosporine A may be used with 6-MP or azathioprine to treat active, severe ulcerative colitis in people who do not respond to intravenous corticosteroids. Other drugs may be given to relax the patient or to relieve pain, diarrhea, or infection. Hospitalization Occasionally, symptoms are severe enough that the person must be hospitalized. For example, a person may have severe bleeding or severe diarrhea that causes dehydration. In such cases the doctor will try to stop diarrhea and loss of blood, fluids, and mineral salts. The patient may need a special diet, feeding through a vein, medications, or sometimes surgery. Surgery About 25 percent to 40 percent of ulcerative colitis patients must eventually have their colons removed because of massive bleeding, severe illness, rupture of the colon, or risk of cancer.

Immunomodulators like azathioprine are employed for those unresponsive to other drugs.

            "A lot depends on the \"type\" of cholesterol a person has. The types are LDL and HDL. It's easy to discern the two because yoyou can think of LDL as being the \"lethal\" type. Below is an excerpt from an article on WebMD that provides better clarification about the types of cholesterol and why having low cholesterol may lead to heart attacks: Cholesterol is transported in a person's blood in special proteins called lipoproteins. The two we are most familiar with are low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol). LDL is often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol. It transports cholesterol from the liver to other body tissues -- depositing excess cholesterol on the walls of arteries to form artery-clogging \"plaques\" that contribute to the development of heart disease and stroke. Yoyou want to have less of this. In contrast, HDL, or good cholesterol, helps remove excess cholesterol from the blood -- transporting it back to the liver, where it can be eliminated from the body. Yoyou want to have more of this type. Furthermore, the latest recommendations are that LDL levels ideally be below 100 -- a significant reduction from previous recommendations -- and that HDL levels be above 40, ideally over 60.",

In such instances, specialized tests, involving Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, provide detailed information on the size of cholesterol particles in different subtypes. These tests often reveal abnormalities that may partially explain the presence of heart disease. It's emphasized that the type of cholesterol plays a crucial role, with LDL (low-density lipoprotein) considered \"bad\" cholesterol responsible for depositing excess cholesterol on artery walls, leading to plaques and contributing to heart disease. On the other hand, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is considered \"good\" cholesterol, aiding in removing excess cholesterol from the blood. While recommendations suggest LDL levels ideally be below 100 and HDL levels be above 40, preferably over 60, it's noted that low cholesterol levels alone do not guarantee protection against heart attacks.

There may also be weight loss (despite normal or increased eating), increased appetite, and irreducible fatigue. These symptoms may also manifest in Type 2 diabetes in patients who present with frank poorly controlled diabetes. Thirst develops because of osmotic effects \u2014 sufficiently high glucose (above the 'renal threshold') in the blood is excreted by the kidneys but this requires water to carry it and causes increased fluid loss, which must be replaced. The lost blood volume will be replaced from water held inside body cells, causing dehydration. Another common presenting symptom is altered vision. Prolonged high blood glucose causes changes in the shape of the lens in the eye, leading to blurred vision and, perhaps, a visit to an optometrist. All unexplained quick changes in eyesight should force a fasting blood glucose test. These are now quick (less than 5 minutes total), inexpensive (materials less than USD $1), and can be safely performed by almost anyone with trivial training. Especially dangerous symptoms in diabetics include the smell of acetone on the patient's breath (a sign of ketoacidosis), Kussmaul breathing (a rapid, deep breathing), and any altered state of consciousness or arousal (hostility and mania are both possible, as is confusion and lethargy). The most dangerous form of altered consciousness is the so-called \"diabetic coma\" which produces unconsciousness.

Whether yoyou are a nurse that is constantly on your feet, or a secretary that spends hours behind a desk and performs data entry, poor posture will inevitably lead to musculo-skeletal injury and pain. It therefore behooves all of us to use good posture in our daily activities, such as sitting, standing and walking. Ideal posture is basically that body configuration that requires the minimal amount of energy to keep us seated or upright. Once yoyou deviate from that position, certain muscle groups get fatigued and problems will result. For instance, if yoyou are a secretary, and yoyou do not use a headset, and yoyou consistently tilt your head to the side to approximate the head to the phone, yoyou are going to have neck pain. A chronically tilted head requires your lateral flexors of the neck to work overtime, resulting in sprains/strains. While standing, our base support starts with our feet. Our spine by design has several curvatures to maximize our ability to balance, and at the same time minimizes the amount of energy required to maintain this posture. High heels, as worn by many women, of course forcibly deviates your body\u2019s curvatures from ideal, leading to back pain, knee pain, and foot pain. An innovative new product on the market, called Z-Coil shoes, may actually help improve your posture. These shoes were actually designed to prevent foot, back, and leg pain. These shoes have a built-in orthotic, a rocker-bottom forefoot neoprene sole, and a metal coil under the heel for maximum shock absorption. Advantages of these shoes include impact reduction, stimulation of the balancing system due to the elasticity of the coil. The loss of the ability to coordinate our muscles for balancing is one of the main reasons seniors fall and sustain hip fractures. I believe, Z-Coils may actually help in maintaining our balancing system, which of course involves the brain. This would be due to the fact that the coil has a give on impact, which forces yoyou to work on your balance. Better balance, less impact on the back from standing, may help your posture, especially if there already is pain and inflammation in the affected area of the spine. Since 1994, Doctor Erwin Linzner has managed a chiropractic practice in Rohnert Park, California. He uses manual manipulation, soft tissue manipulation and rehabilitation for a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. He believes that wellness comes from healthful living, which includes proper nutrition, exercise, and sleep. These are the primary factors that prevent disease, but also need to be addressed in healing from any condition.",

This procedure does not interfere with the ovaries' ability to release eggs or affect the menstrual cycle. The woman's ovaries continue to ovulate, producing eggs, but the sperm cannot reach the egg due to the blocked fallopian tubes.

Does it give any harmful side effects?) and efficacy (Does it actually make yoyou feel better?). Your doctor will be the best person to talk to in order to decide on which medication is best for you. There are a number of medications that are available for COPD. There are bronchodilators such as Ventolin (salbutamol), Serevent(salmeterol), and the newest Spiriva(tiotropium bromide)- these generally are used to relieve shortness of breath and open up the airways to the lungs. There are long-acting and short-acting bronchodilators. This is the largest class of drugs used for COPD. There are oral (prednisone) or inhaled corticosteroids, including Flovent (fluticasone), Pulmicort (budesonide). These are more for treating inflammation in the lungs, and only help a small portion of COPD sufferers. This class of drugs was first developed to treat asthma patients, which is a different pathology. New research, however, shows that there are more common elements to asthma and COPD than pulmonologists had once believed. As such, they are seeing that some COPDers benefit from asthma medications. There have been studies that link COPD to an inflammatory response via the phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) pathway and new drugs are currently being tested that could make it to market. Ariflo (cilomilast) is the drug that is the closest to being approved, with other drug candidates coming from Bayer and Byk Gulden also being developed. If your COPD is relatively advanced, and your quality of life has not improved greatly, PDE-4 medications may offer an alternative. However, one compound from Merck was discontinued due to safety concerns because the drug caused one case of colitis. Much like all drugs, one must seriously weigh the benefits and risks. This is an exercise best performed with a trained physician or pulmonologist. Best of luck.",

It manifests with both physical and emotional effects, giving rise to positive or negative feelings. Stress can serve as a positive force, driving us to take action and gain new perspectives. Conversely, it can lead to negative emotions such as distrust, rejection, anger, and depression, contributing to various health issues such as headaches, upset stomach, insomnia, and more serious conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Stress is a part of life, triggered by events like the death of a loved one, the birth of a child, job promotions, or new relationships. How we respond to stress determines whether it enhances or hinders our well-being as we adapt to different circumstances."

        "answers": [
            "Aparantly there are three theories as to why we yawn The Physiological Theory -- Our bodies induce yawning to drawn in more oxygen or remove a build-up of carbon dioxide. This theory helps explain why we yawn in groups. Larger groups produce more carbon dioxide, which means our bodies would act to draw in more oxygen and get rid of the excess carbon dioxide. However, if our bodies make us yawn to drawn in needed oxygen, wouldn't we yawn during exercise? Robert Provine, a psychologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and a leading expert on yawning, has tested this theory. Giving people additional oxygen didn't decrease yawning and decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in a subject's environment also didn't prevent yawning. The Evolution Theory -- Some think that yawning is something that began with our ancestors, who used yawning to show their teeth and intimidate others. An offshoot of this theory is the idea that yawning developed from early man as a signal for us to change activities. The Boredom Theory -- In the dictionary, yawning is said to be caused by boredom, fatigue or drowsiness. Although we do tend to yawn when bored or tired, this theory doesn't explain why Olympic athletes yawn right before they compete in their event. It's doubtful that they are bored with the world watching them",
            "\"While the dictionary tells us that yawning is caused by being fatigued, drowsy or bored, scientists are discovering that there is more to yawning than what most people think. Not much is known about why we yawn or if it serves any useful function, and very little research has been done on the subject. However, there are several theories about why we yawn.\" See the source link for more.",

The Physiological Theory suggests that yawning is induced to draw in more oxygen or eliminate excess carbon dioxide, potentially explaining group yawning. However, testing this theory with additional oxygen and decreased carbon dioxide levels did not align with decreased yawning. The Evolution Theory suggests that yawning may have originated from early humans as a way to display teeth or signal a change in activities. The Boredom Theory, while commonly associated with yawning, is challenged by instances like Olympic athletes yawning before competing. Overall, the exact purpose of yawning remains unclear, with some indications that it may be related to the body's desire for more oxygen in the brain."

The affected area is sometimes said to have 'fallen asleep'. A common cause is leaning or lying awkwardly on a limb, which either presses against the nerves or reduces the blood supply to the local area. Changing position quickly restores normal feeling. Any numbness is soon replaced by the tingling and prickling sensation, as the nerves start sending messages again to the brain and spinal cord. In some cases, pins and needles are caused by nerve damage or certain disorders of the central nervous system. Always see your doctor if yoyou experience frequent or persistent bouts of pins and needles. Symptoms The symptoms of pins and needles include: * Hands and feet are usually affected * Initial numbness and heaviness * Prickling and tingling sensation on the skin * Return of normal feeling a few minutes after changing position. A range of causes Pins and needles can be caused by a wide range of events and conditions, including: * Pressure on nerves * Reduced blood supply * Nerve injury * Hyperventilation or breathing excessively * The effect of toxic substances on the nerves, such as alcohol or lead * Certain medications * Diabetes * Multiple sclerosis * Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland) * Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) * Stroke.",

A diminishing sperm count is not reversible! Dr Simon Fishel of the Worldwide Infertility Network - which has both European and US bases - suggests six ways to maintain sufficient amounts of healthy sperm: Avoid hot baths - the testicles need to be cooler than the rest of the body. Wear loose underwear - boxers rather than Y-fronts. Stop smoking and refrain from all recreational drugs. Cut down on alcohol. Increase your intake of zinc, which can be found in grains, beans, milk and meat. Increase your intake of selenium. For men with low sperm counts, but who are still fertile, there is no need to run to the nearest IVF clinic just yet. It is undoubtedly more pleasant to conceive a child in bed than in a clinic and clinics suggest that men try to increase their production of healthy sperm first, before undergoing expensive fertility treatments. To increase your sperm count: Your diet should include the anti-oxidant vitamins C and E, which can be found in citrus fruits. Eating a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables is recommended anyway. Men are at their sexual peak in the morning, at this time more sperm is produced than in the evening. Reduce your caffeine intake. No coffee, tea or stimulant drinks. If none of these precautions appear to be helping, it may be necessary for yoyou and your partner to visit an assisted reproduction clinic to ascertain fertility levels. Many techniques are available to induce pregnancy using sperm from men with extremely low sperm counts, so there is no need to despair. \"Although yoyou might have a high sperm count, many of them might not be functioning properly\", explains Ms Butler. \"Motility for most samples is around 50%. Then we examine how well they swim. We also look at the morphology - the shape of the sperm\".",

Despite low sperm counts, various techniques exist for inducing pregnancy without immediately turning to fertility clinics.

In SARS with moderate respiratory illness, you'll note a fever higher than 100.4\u00b0 F (38\u00b0 C) and one or more of the following symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or hypoxia. In SARS with severe symptoms of respiratory illness, you'll find a temperature greater than 100.4\u00b0 F, one or more of the previously mentioned clinical signs and symptoms, and a chest X-ray that reveals pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The chest X-ray may be normal at first, but changes may appear 3 or 4 days following infection, particularly in the lung bases. If your patient has some or all of these suspicious signs and symptoms, take a detailed medical and travel history to determine his risk of exposure to SARS. Suspect SARS if he reports either of the following circumstances within 10 days of symptom onset: * travel to an area with a known or suspected SARS outbreak. Just passing through the airport counts. The CDC Web site (httpV/www.cdc.gov/ ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm) can tell yoyou which areas qualify * close contact with someone known or suspected to have SARS. If yoyou work in a primary care provider's office and suspect that a patient has SARS, contact the hospital before sending the patient there, so that hospital staff can make arrangements to prevent transmission of SARS to others in the facility. If yoyou suspect SARS... Immediately have your patient put on a surgical face mask and make arrangements to isolate him, ideally in a negative-pressure isolation room. Protect yourself by donning an N95 disposable paniculate respirator or surgical mask, gown, gloves, and eye protection and observing meticulous hand hygiene. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that any health care provider caring for a patient with a suspected case of SARS notify local public health authorities as soon as possible, so the patient's close contacts can be tracked and monitored. (Health Canada recommends similar management strategies.) Diagnostic tests for SARS The SARS virus may be detected in a patient's nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal secretions, blood serum, or stool. The CDC, as well as many state public health labs, can process specimens. Three types of diagnostic tests are used for SARS: * a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test to detect RNA of SARS-CoV Two tests on two different specimens must be positive to confirm SARS. * serum tests to detect antibodies IgM (gamma M immunoglobulin) and IgG (gamma G immunoglobulin). The test result is negative if no SARS-CoV antibodies are found in serum obtained more than 28 days after symptom onset. * a viral cell culture test to detect SARS-CoV In September 2003, a 15-minute, palm-sized SARS detection kit was developed by Genelabs Diagnostics and the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, both of Singapore. This test generates accurate results with just a drop of serum, plasma, or blood and is designed to be used by people without special training in locations (such as airports) where lab facilities aren't available. The test is expected to be available to hospitals soon. Other helpful tests Along with baseline vital signs, chest X-rays, and the diagnostic tests listed above, tests that may help confirm or rule out SARS include a complete blood cell count, arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry values, clotting profile, respiratory viral panel for influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial viruses, metabolic profile, examination of bronchoalveolar lavage from the lower respiratory tract, C-reactive protein test, and Legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigen testing.

Also important is where yoyou apply the ice- more specifically right at the middle of the back of your skull. A nurse taught me this trick and it is SO helpful. Since yoyou have hair there, yoyou don't need to use the pillowcase; just apply directly. Use another pack at the base of your skull and a smaller one across your eyes or temples.

            "I think that mental pain is worse simply because if there is enough mental pain it can be the reason to inflict physical pain either on oneself or another person. If you're talking about abuse, that's a different story. Both mental and physical abuse should be taken care of in the same aspect, it doesn't matter if an abuser doesn't \"touch\" the other person, it's a matter of the permanent damage caused. When someone who is depressed or has been mentally abused says they are \"in pain\" they mean it. It's a proven fact that when someone who is mentally \"in pain\" says they are in pain, the brain is responding in the same way it would if there were physical pain being inflicted on the person. So, mental pain causes physical pain and vice versa. Sorry if this answer is kind of out of order and long winded, but I wanted to try to explain myself.",

Yoyou really don't have to. \"There are several complications to anal sex: Pain from hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids can be fragile and prone to bleeding, although they don't usually cause the kind of pain you've described. Yoyou can frequently feel a hemorrhoid as a swollen, tender lump in the anal area. You'll often notice blood from a bleeding hemorrhoid on toilet paper after a bowel movement, or on the stool itself. Pain and bleeding can also occur when there's a small tear in the lining of the anus called an anal fissure. Even small fissures can be pretty painful because they often cause spasms of the opening of the anus. They heal slowly because they're irritated repeatedly during bowel movements. With anal fissures, yoyou may also see blood on toilet paper or on the stool itself. A rare, but serious, complication after anal sex is a hole (perforation) in the colon. This dangerous problem requires hospitalization, surgery to repair the hole, and antibiotics to prevent infection. A colonic perforation will usually cause fever and severe pain and pressure in the abdomen. This condition requires immediate medical attention, either through your health care provider or your local hospital emergency department. Sexually transmitted diseases can infect the anus in much the same way as vaginal intercouse. My advice to yoyou if yoyou do not have fever and the pain is somewhat bearable, is to take an colic pain killer, a stool softner for a couple of days. If yoyou do not improve then yoyou will have to consult someone face to face and yoyou may even need a scope exam. A surgeon would be best at evaluating this condition.\" {{{snuggles}}} Teddy Bear",

Myelination plays a crucial role in the efficient transmission of signals between different regions of the brain. The prefrontal cortex, responsible for executive functions such as decision-making and impulse control, communicates with the limbic system, which governs emotions and basic survival instincts. Myelination of the neural pathways between these areas is essential for the integration of cognitive and emotional processes. Proper myelination ensures that signals related to decision-making and emotional responses are effectively transmitted and coordinated. Disruptions or deficiencies in myelination can lead to difficulties in regulating emotions, making sound decisions, and maintaining appropriate social behaviors.

However, once the individual stops using meth, they are expected to return to a normal state of awareness.

            "Bipolar disorder--which is also known as manic-depressive illness and will be called by both names throughout this publication--is a mental illness involving episodes of serious mania and depression. The person's mood usually swings from overly \"high\" and irritable to sad and hopeless, and then back again, with periods of normal mood in between. Bipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood and continues throughout life. It is often not recognized as an illness, and people who have it may suffer needlessly for years or even decades. Effective treatments are available that greatly alleviate the suffering caused by bipolar disorder and can usually prevent its devastating complications. These include marital break-ups, job loss, alcohol and drug abuse, and suicide. Here are some facts about bipolar disorder. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AWARENESS Manic-depressive illness has a devastating impact on many people. At least 2 million Americans suffer from manic-depressive illness. For those afflicted with the illness, it is extremely distressing and disruptive. Like other serious illnesses, bipolar disorder is also hard on spouses, family members, friends, and employers. Family members of people with bipolar disorder often have to cope with serious behavioral problems (such as wild spending sprees) and the lasting consequences of these behaviors. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families and is believed to be inherited in many cases. Despite vigorous research efforts, a specific genetic defect associated with the disease has not yet been detected. Bipolar illness has been diagnosed in children under age 12, although it is not common in this age bracket. It can be confused with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, so careful diagnosis is necessary. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RECOGNITION Bipolar disorder involves cycles of mania and depression. Signs and symptoms of mania include discrete periods of: Increased energy, activity, restlessness, racing thoughts, and rapid talking Excessive \"high\" or euphoric feelings Extreme irritability and distractibility Decreased need for sleep Unrealistic beliefs in one's abilities and powers Uncharacteristically poor judgment A sustained period of behavior that is different from usual Increased sexual drive Abuse of drugs, particularly cocaine, alcohol, and sleeping medications Provocative, intrusive, or aggressive behavior Denial that anything is wrong Signs and symptoms of depression include discrete periods of: Persistent sad, anxious, or empty mood Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness Loss of interest or pleasure in ordinary activities, including sex Decreased energy, a feeling of fatigue or of being \"slowed down\" Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions Restlessness or irritability Sleep disturbances Loss of appetite and weight, or weight gain Chronic pain or other persistent bodily symptoms that are not caused by physical disease Thoughts of death or suicide; suicide attempts It may be helpful to think of the various mood states in manic-depressive illness as a spectrum or continuous range. At one end is severe depression, which shades into moderate depression; then come mild and brief mood disturbances that many people call \"the blues,\" then normal mood, then hypomania (a mild form of mania), and then mania. Some people with untreated bipolar disorder have repeated depressions and only an occasional episode of hypomania (bipolar II). In the other extreme, mania may be the main problem and depression may occur only infrequently. In fact, symptoms of mania and depression may be mixed together in a single \"mixed\" bipolar",

            "First of all, the answers listed on this thread are only PART of the complete answer. I have provided, in the source section, a link to the website that deals with bipolar disorder. This diease WAS FORMALLY known as manic depressive disorder, however, as not all bipolar people exhibit the signs of manic depressiviness, the 2 disorders were eventually seperated and made distinct to one and other. Bipolar is simply a form of a depressive state that can make a person have dramatic mood swings over a long or short period of time. Most people that suffer from bipolar disorder can be just fine for many weeks or months, and then all of a sudden turn to a major depressive state, be self destructive, or perhaps even suicidal in nature; and then a few more weeks or months down the road, they will be just fine again. This bipolar disorder has to do with a chemeical imbalance in the brain between seritonin and other chemicals that inihibit our natural ability to control impulses and deprssive states. This is however a condition that responds well to medication and therapy. So, please, don't be worried too much about them. They will be just fine, your job would be to be supportive, and be their friends, no matter what. Please see the website below for more information on bipolar disorder.",
            "FAQ: Bipolar Disorder... 1. What is bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder is a common, recurrent, severe psychiatric illness that affects an individual's mood, behavior and ability to think clearly. It occurs in 1% to 2% of the population in the United States. A variant, called bipolar II disorder, is probably even more common and occurs in up to 3% of the general population in this country. 2. What are the differences between bipolar I and bipolar II disorders? Bipolar I disorder is characterized by episodes of mania that alternate with periods of depression or periods in which individuals have simultaneously occurring manic and depressive symptoms called mixed states. In contrast, bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and milder symptoms of mania, called hypomania. Hypomanic episodes typically do not impair an individual's ability to function to the extent that full-blown manic episodes do additionally; hypomanic episodes are not complicated by psychotic symptoms. 3. What is rapid cycling? The term rapid cycling was originally coined by David Dunner, M.D., and Ron Fieve, M.D., in the 1970s when they identified a group of individuals who did not respond well to lithium. These patients typically had four or more episodes of mania or depression in the 12-month interval prior to lithium treatment. This definition has been adopted formally by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.) and specifically means the occurrence of four or more mood episodes within the preceding year. In severe cases, rapid cycling can occur even within a one-day period. 4. At what age does bipolar disorder appear? Bipolar disorder most commonly presents in the late teens and early 20s. Unfortunately, for most individuals, lifelong treatment may be required to prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Equally unfortunate is evidence that the illness often goes undiagnosed and untreated for many years; the longer the illness progresses without treatment, the greater the impairment in an individual's psychological, educational and vocational development. Additionally, untreated bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. 5. Is bipolar disorder genetic? Bipolar disorder, among all psychiatric illnesses, may have the greatest genetic contribution. For instance, if an individual has a parent with bipolar disorder, the chance that the individual's child will have bipolar disorder is about nine-fold greater than in the general population, with the risk rising from about 1% to about 10%. The inheritability of this illness is estimated to be anywhere from 50% to 80%. On the other hand, if a person with bipolar disorder is thinking about having children, there are still good odds that the child will not have bipolar illness. So the genetic determinants of the illness are complicated. 6. How is bipolar disorder treated? The cornerstone of treatment is medications that treat acute manic, depressive or mixed episodes, and which, in the long run, attempt to prevent the recurrence of these episodes. Such medications include lithium, divalproex (Depakote) and, more recently, some of the atypical antipsychotics as well as antidepressants. Psychotherapy plays an important role in improving the course and outcome of this illness in people. In particular, those with bipolar disorder often have strained relationships with loved ones because of their experiences during manic or depressive episodes; psychotherapy can help repair these torn relationships. In addition, psychotherapy can educate people about the signs and symptoms of their illness, how to pay attention to warning signs and how to nip emerging episodes in the bud. Psychotherapy can also help individuals cope with the stress that can sometimes precipitate manic or depressive episodes. 7. What medications are used to treat bipolar disorder?

The short answer is yoyou will have to invest alot of time (to eat) and money (to purchase alot of food). More than someone with a average body type needs. In my experience it took alot of work and calories to make any gains. Steady high calorie diet and a weight lifting regime for our body type (high resistance, low reps). The bad news is this. I had to constantly work at maintaining a higher weight. When I slacked off the pounds would shed off in weeks. Now for the hard advice that yoyou will not want to accept. Learn to accept yourself and yoyou body type. There is nothing wrong with being skinny. If yoyou eat regularly and healthy, yoyou will look slim and healthy. Perhaps later in life your metabolism will slow down and yoyou will gain a few pounds. That is what I've been told. But I have been skinny since I was eleven, I am thirty-seven now and weigh just a few pounds more than when I was eight-teen. Want to BULK up. Join the military. I was in the NAVY. Between the basic training and the free meals I gained 30 lbs in two years. Good Luck",
            "FAT DOES NOT TURN TO MUSCLE. They are two different tissues and one does not be come the other. Yoyou either gain muscle or lose muscle or gain fat or lose fat. The only way to gain muscle is to work out (heavy weights - low reps) and compensate with protein. If yoyou are doing cardio - stop. I am a trainer - I get this question all the time!",
            "the key here, because I have the same problem but don't really care too much about it is...yoyou have to figure out about how many cals your body actually burns in a day. Then using a protein whey drink along with eating 3 -4 meals a day, yoyou have to make your increase cals to be greater then what yoyou burn. Along with doing this yoyou need to work out with weights. To give yoyou a start yoyou probably burn 3500 cals a day.",

            "Yoyou need to eat lots of proteins and carbs. Proteins help to build muscle and carbs will help yoyou restore fat. I am not saying get fat of course, but those 2 things will help yoyou the most. Do not go buying supplements etc because they will do more harm than good. Remember that fat turns to muscle as yoyou work out, so have 6-9 servings of carbs and 6 servings of proteins. Good luck!",
            "A lot of high quality protein, up to 1 gram per pound of body weight. Choose high quality so you're gaining muscle and not fat. Progressive weight training 3-4 times a week with minimal or no cardio. Start with moderate weight for 7-9 reps and try to increase the weight by about 5% per week. The body has to be trained to increase strength. Go light the 6th week and then restart the cycle with the same weight as the 3rd week. Ironman's POF system works pretty well. If some of the exercises seem awkward, feel free to substitute an exercise that is more comfortable. For instance, I don't like bent over rows with the palms facing out. It feels more like a bicep exercise than a back exercise. Supplement-wise, creatine is fairly cheap and pretty effective. It's not necessary to follow the loading instructions you'll see on the container. You'll still get results starting off with 5 grams a day. Be sure to get plenty of sleep so your body has time to grow."

It's important to debunk the misconception that fat can transform into muscle\u2014these are distinct tissues that don't interchange. Instead, individuals can either gain or lose muscle or fat. Muscle gain typically results from dedicated workouts, particularly with heavy weights and low repetitions, accompanied by a protein-rich diet.

            "Lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE) is an autoimmune disease, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues as though they were foreign substances. Lupus is not contagious. No one knows exactly what causes the body to attack its own tissues. A person may be born with a certain genetic makeup that affects how the immune system functions or makes him or her at risk for lupus. A combination of factors can trigger the autoimmune process, some of which may affect one person but not another. 1 Genetic researchers have found specific gene defects common to people with lupus, each affecting some aspect of the immune system, cell function, and hormones. While one such gene defect is unlikely to cause a problem, a combination of them makes it more likely that a person will develop lupus. 2 Exposure to ultraviolet B light, usually from sunlight, is known to trigger the disease process and symptom flares. Hormonal factors are linked to autoimmune disease, though the link is poorly understood. A recent study did not find evidence that the hormones estrogen or prolactin increased the risk of lupus. 3 Some medications are suspected triggers of lupus and symptom flares. Some infections are suspected triggers. Some people who have cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus (such as fifth disease), and hepatitis C infections eventually develop lupus. The Epstein-Barr virus has been linked to lupus in children. Chemical exposure has been known to trigger lupus. Suspected chemical toxins include trichloroethylene in well water and silica dust. Hair dyes and straighteners, once linked to lupus, are no longer considered to be lupus triggers. Home Treatment Good self-care is essential to managing lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE). Learn to recognize your body's warning signs of a flare. Warning signs may include increased fatigue, joint pain, rash, or fever. When yoyou notice any of these signs, take steps to control your symptoms. Stress may trigger lupus symptoms. Keep your stress level as low as yoyou can. Keep your daily schedule as simple as possible. Keep your list of obligations to others to a bare minimum. Delegate to others. Exercise regularly. A daily walk, for example, can reduce stress, clear your head, improve your mood, and help fight fatigue. Use relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga, and guided imagery to calm your body and mind. Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of lupus. To fight fatigue: Get plenty of rest. Some people with lupus need up to 12 hours of sleep every night. Pace yourself. Limit tiring activities. Ask others for help. Don't try to do everything yourself. Take short breaks from your usual daily activities. Consider cutting down on work hours or getting help with parenting responsibilities, at least during periods when lupus symptoms are severe. Exercise regularly. Physical activity boosts energy and helps yoyou stay in good condition. Walking and swimming are good forms of exercise for people with lupus. If yoyou suspect that depression is contributing to your fatigue, get prompt treatment from your doctor, a mental health professional, or both. Take care of your skin. Ask your doctor about the use of corticosteroid creams to relieve skin symptoms that are particularly troublesome. If yoyou are bothered by the way a lupus rash looks on your face or if yoyou have scars from lupus, yoyou can try makeup, such as Covermark, to cover the rash or scars. Ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) light triggers disease flares in up to 70% of people with lupus. 11 UVB, as from sunlight, can start or worsen skin rash, joint pain, or fatigue. To minimize your exposure: Avoid the sun. If yoyou must be in the sun, cover your arms and legs, wear a hat, and apply broad-spectrum sunscreen (covering both UVA and UVB rays) with a high sun protection factor (40 SPF or higher) to protect your skin.

            "Ocular myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disease of the neuromuscular junction resulting in hallmark variability in muscle weakness and fatigability. MG is an autoimmune disease where anomalous antibodies are produced against the naturally occurring acetylcholine (ACh) receptors in voluntary muscles. MG may be limited to the muscles of the eye (ocular MG), leading to abrupt onset of weakness/fatigability of the eyelids or eye movement. MG may also involve other muscle groups (generalized MG). This article will focus on ocular MG, as the generalized form is discussed elsewhere (Myasthenia gravis). Although these blocking antibodies may be confined to one of the larger muscles responsible for moving the face or appendages or for breathing, about 90% of MG patients eventually have eye involvement. The most common symptoms are double vision (diplopia) and eyelid drooping (ptosis), whereas the pupil is always spared. Diplopia occurs when MG affects a single extraocular muscle in one eye, limiting eye movement and leading to double vision when the eye is turned toward the affected muscle. Ptosis occurs when the muscle responsible for eyelid elevation is affected on one or both sides, leading to eyelid drooping. Although these symptoms may not be readily apparent in well-rested patients, weakness can usually be induced with exercise of the commonly affected muscles (ie. by having the patient look upward for about 60 seconds). In 75% of MG cases, the initial manifestation is in the eye. Within 2 years, 80% of patients with ocular onset of MG will progress to involve other muscle groups, thereby developing generalized MG. The other 20% of patients continue to have purely ocular MG. If MG is confined to the ocular muscles for more than 3 years, there is a 94% likelihood that the symptoms will not worsen or generalize. Aside from asymmetric ptosis (worse with fatigue, sustained upgaze and at the end of the day) and variable limitation of extraocular muscles/diplopia, other clinical signs of ocular MG include gaze-evoked nystagmus (rapid, involuntary, oscillatory motion of the eyeball) and Cogan\u2019s lid twitch (upper lid twitch present when patient looks straight ahead after looking down for 10-15 seconds). MG is characteristically variable in course, with the frequency of diplopia and ptosis affected by environmental, emotional and physical factors such as bright sunlight, stress, viral illness, menstruation, pregnancy, etc. Spontaneous remission can occur in any patient and remain for years. In a study of the natural history of generalized MG among 168 patients (with an average follow-up of 12 years), 14% experienced complete remission."

Initial manifestations are often in the eyes, progressing to generalized MG in 80% of cases within two years. However, 20% of patients maintain purely ocular MG.

That can scar up your fallopian tubes, so that even if yoyou ovulate, the eggs can't get down to uterus. Surgery can sometimes help, or just keep trying. Take your oral temperature every morning. It will rise a little bit when yoyou ovulate, which is prime time to try getting pregnant. Ovulation is generally about 14 days before the start of your period. If your periods are like clockwork, then count back 14 days from the scheduled start of your next period. That is time to \"do it\". It helps for the woman to have an orgasm to get pregnant. That helps move the sperm up through the uterus to the tubes and the egg.",

        "labelled_summary": "Irregular periods may indicate issues with ovulation, potentially due to past gonorrhea or chlamydia infections that could scar the fallopian tubes. To increase your chances of conceiving, track your basal body temperature, which rises slightly during ovulation, usually occurring about 14 days before your period. If your menstrual cycle is regular, count back 14 days from your next expected period and aim to have intercourse during this time. Female orgasm can aid sperm transport, but it's important to remember that yoyou can't fake a positive pregnancy test result. Stress can also affect fertility, so managing stress is essential in your journey to conception."

        "question": "What is the meaning of EMR as in a physician's office?",
        "answers": [
            "The difference between Personal Health Records (PHRs) and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is scope. Personal Heatlh Record is the basic unit of an EHR - that is, it only describes information about one person. A PHR is one instance of a EHR. EHR could be used to describe a collection of many PHRs in a system at a particular hospital, for example. One EHR though describes the entire health of a patient, which can include old information (past surgeries, for example), current information (what medications are being prescribed), or future information (what is the future medical treatment plan for this patient). Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are similar to EHRs but are more specific to medical information. Health information is broader and may include information on the patient's diet, their consent in a clinical trial, and other non-medically related details of their health. The official standards for these terms and definitions can be found below. These are put out by the HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society) and approved by the Health Level 7 committee - a major player in electronic medical record standards.",
            "This is a complex issue because there are different ways of looking at the attributes of \"records\" and many different stakeholders in healthcare that view the \"person\" from different perspectives. Terminology is key, and there is still no ccnsensus on terms. Patient-centric health records could be EMR, EHR, PHR, CPR or many other things. There is a \"view\" that keys off the name of the person themselves, which is the most common way for interacting with any type of electronic records in healthcare. However, the creation of data, communication around it, organization, and rules may well be \"clinician or organization-centric\". A \"Person-centered\" record would revolve primarily around that person regardless of whether they went to hospitals, pharmacies, alternative care providers, clinics, or did self care. The rules around access, what types of information are included, how information is validated, audits of activity, and how communication occurs would emanate from the preferences of the \"person\" not the constraints of a specific organization, practice, or integrated network. One way to summarize is that an EMR is a set of records and processes for whom the primary stakeholder is the clinician practice (even if in the context of a hospital). An Inbox, a document repository, an ordering system, and disease registry/alerts have certain features that are more important when in the context of an EMR. Documenting care is critical to being reimbursed, if yoyou are a clinician. It is more critical for safety and clarity if yoyou are a patient, because of the focus on what others might need to do with the information. Of course in the real world this is a far more \"grey zone\" and there is more overlap than not. A PHR could be viewed as a set of records and processes for whom the primary stakeholder is the patient and family caregiver. There might be times when it is more helpful for a clinician to be looking at, updating or interacting with a PHR than with their own EMR! (it is one thing to send a message out from an EMR and hope it gets to the patient, it is another thing to post a message about a patient directly into their \"personal space\" where there might be a clearer understanding about how that patient is intending to receive and interact with information). As the world of online personal information management and identity management mature, this focus on the primary \"stakeholder\" might become a more important one. The American Health Information Management Association has done some very good work around the PHR. They represent a very large number of medical records professionals, and have a broad industry perspective on the PHR. Medicare, as well as other large payers, are actively exploring their roles relative to the patient-centric PHR as well. Active ongoing public diaogues and blogs in which both clinicians, consumers, care managers, and other stakeholders participate, might be a very good way to gradually develop a more universal set of definitions around the PHR itself."

        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, the distinction between Personal Health Records (PHRs) and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) lies in their scope. A PHR represents the individual unit within an EHR, encapsulating information about one person. An EHR, on the other hand, can encompass a collection of many PHRs within a specific healthcare system. EHRs provide a comprehensive view of a patient's health, spanning past, present, and future information, including surgeries, current medications, and future treatment plans. Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are closely related to EHRs but are more focused on medical information, while health information, a broader term, may include non-medical details such as diet or consent in a clinical trial. The standards for these terms are defined by organizations like HIMSS and Health Level 7. The evolving landscape of healthcare records involves considerations of terminology, stakeholder perspectives, and ongoing dialogues to establish universal definitions, especially regarding patient-centric records. The PHR, with the patient as the primary stakeholder, offers a unique space for individuals and family caregivers, potentially influencing the future development of healthcare information management. Ongoing discussions, involving clinicians, consumers, care managers, and others, are crucial for refining these definitions and understanding the roles of various record types in the healthcare ecosystem."

Yoyou really need to go see a doctor now! Why? There is a a very small possibility it is something serious. Perhaps more importantly, yoyou are in pain fairly often! And yoyou are very worried! And it is impacting your relationship with others! Odds are they will do a mammogram (an xray of your breast) and perhaps an ultrasound. Both are really pretty painless and quick (I have had both). SO, for the price of a doctors visit, mamogram and ultrasound, yoyou will probably shed the 1000 pound weight that yoyou are dragging around -- worry. OTOH, if it is cancer (again, a very long shot) yoyou can make the treatment decisions then. Finding out only gives yoyou options -- waiting only takes them away. Finally, yoyou ask how long could yoyou live assuming it is breast cancer? Assuming yoyou do (and I would say this is a very very very very remote chance), it would depend on the type, any spread and treatment choices. Please consider talking to your mom. I don't know her so I am no expert in how to approach her. Yoyou might start with, Mom can I tell yoyou something if yoyou promise not to laugh? or Mom, I am really scared and need your advice.",

            "It is highly unlikely that yoyou actually have breast cancer, especially since yoyou have had lumps since the fifth grade. First of all, do yoyou have a family history of breast cancer? If yes, then the relevant concern depends on the \"degree\" of the relatives. In other words, yoyou would be at high risk if your mother had breast cancer but there would be gradually less risk if it was your grandmother versus your cousin, for instance. Some women naturally have fibrocystic breasts ... cysts just develop now and then, but they are completely benign. Some things tend to increase the frequency of developing breast cysts ... such as caffeine intake. Since yoyou are 18 now, it sounds like yoyou are no longer covered on your parents' insurance policy; however, yoyou might still be eligible if yoyou are a student so please double-check. Otherwise, yoyou can try to find a part-time job with insurance benefits and go from there. Once yoyou obtain insurance coverage, make an appointment to see either your primary care physician or an Ob/Gyn doctor for a breast examination. (As a side note, yoyou are also due for a PAP smear now that yoyou are age 18, regardless of whether you've been sexually active.) The physician will give his/her opinion regarding the breast masses; however, I expect that they would only recommend that yoyou continue to observe them. The physician will likely instruct yoyou to perform monthly breast self-examination techniques and note any changes in your breast tissue. If yoyou notice any differences, then your physician would probably suggest that yoyou make a return appointment for evaluation. Keep in mind, though, that the cysts may come and go or become more prominent at certain times during your menstrual cycle ... so try not to be overly alarmed if this occurs. If your physician palpates an abnormality and would like to refer yoyou for more breast studies, then yoyou may need to undergo one of the following tests: mammogram or breast ultrasound. Breast tissue is extremely dense at such a young age which could cause the mammogram to be a less valuable screening tool and not necessarily worth the discomfort that goes along with the procedure. Given the choice, a breast ultrasound may ultimately give a more thorough diagnosis and avoid the discomfort associated with a mammogram.",

Despite financial concerns, seeking medical attention is crucial for both physical and emotional well-being.

        "question": "what is best cure for eczema?",
        "answers": [
            "Eczema Treatment Guide Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a common problem in infants and children. It usually begins between two and six months of age with very dry and sensitive skin that will then become red and extremely itchy. It often starts on the forehead, cheeks and scalp and spreads to the trunk, creases of the elbows, knees, and wrists. With scratching the rash may become raw, crusted and weepy. It is not yet known what causes it, but it does seem to run in families that have a history of asthma, allergies or atopic dermatitis. It is a chronic disease, but only about a third of children with infantile atopic dermatitis will continue to have problems with it as they get older. There is no cure for this common condition. The main treatments are aimed at controlling and preventing inflammation and itching and include avoiding triggers, frequent bathing and hydrating of the skin, liberal use of moisturizers and lubricants, and the use of steroid creams for flare ups. New Medications Protopic: or tacrolimus, an immunomodulator ointment that in the 0.03% strength is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) when other therapies have not been effective. Elidel: or pimercrolimus, is another non-steroidal cream that in the 1% strength is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (eczema) in children over 2 years of age. Lubricants To help with dryness, these creams, such as Eucerin, Nivea, or Lubriderm, should be used every day, even when the eczema isn't flaring-up! Apply right after baths within 3 minutes (and after the steroid creams) to help trap in moisture and throughout the day as needed. For severely dry skin, try using an ointment, such as Aquaphor. Alternative lubricants that some parents find useful include Hydrolatum and Vanicream. Many experts recommend avoiding moisturizing lotions, as they often don't work as well as a cream or ointment. Steroid Creams These are the main treatments for atopic dermatitis when it flares up, and should be applied right after baths (and before a lubricant) and again during the day as directed. When the rash improves, cut back on how often yoyou are using it and then stop until the rash flares up again. Common steroid creams include Cutivate, Westcort and Artistocort, and Elocon. Avoid using prescription steroid creams on the face or in the diaper area, unless specifically instructed to do so. An over the counter 1% Hydrocortisone cream is safer in these areas. For severe cases of eczema, a steroid ointment may be more effective than a cream. If your child's eczema improves when he is on a steroid and then quickly flares up again when yoyou stop, it may help to use a 'step down' strategy where yoyou taper the use of the steroid and use it less often, for example every other day and then 2-3 times a week, before finally stopping it. Or use a less potent steroid, like over the counter hydrocortizone after using a prescription strength steroid like Cutivate or Elocon. Yoyou might also ask your doctor about one of the newer non-steroidal medications, like Protopic or Elidel. Bathing and Eczema Bathing and eczema is a controversial topic, but many people think the practice of limiting baths is old school or old fashioned. Many experts now recommend a daily bath for kids with eczema. A daily bath for at least 15-20 minutes helps to moisturize the skin and make it less itchy. Be sure to use a mild, nondrying soap, such as Dove, Neutrogena, Tone, Caress, Dial, Basis, or Purpose, avoid vigorous scrubbing, use a soft towel to pat the skin dry and immediately (within 3 minutes) apply a lubricating cream afterwards. If your child's skin is not tolerating a daily bath, limit baths to every other day or try using a soap substitute, such as Cetaphil. Avoid using bubble baths, harsh or drying soaps and keep shampoo off the affected areas. Itching Relief Atopic dermatit",

Common initial and chronic complaints are fever, malaise, joint pains, myalgias and fatigue. Because they are so often seen with other diseases, these signs and symptoms are not part of the diagnostic criteria for SLE. When occurring in conjunction with other signs and symptoms, however, they are considered suggestive. SLE is a chronic disease with no cure. There are, however, some medications, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants which can control the disease and prevent flares. Flares are typically treated with steroids, with DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheutmatic drugs) to suppress the disease process, reduce steroid needs and prevent flares. DMARDs commonly in use are the antimalarials (e.g. hydroxychloroquine) and azathioprine. Cyclophosphamide is used for severe nephritis or other organ-damaging complications. Patients who require steroids frequently may develop obesity, diabetes and osteoporosis. Hence, steroids are avoided where possible. Measures such as avoiding sunlight (to prevent problems due to photosensitivity) may also have some effect. Other immunosuppressants and autologous stem cell transplants are under investigation.

        "answers": [
            "They are actually both antihistimines (although Benadryl does come in a topical formula). Allegra requires a prescription, Benadryl does not.

I believe Benadryl allergy is a 50mg version (so yoyou need to take a more doses per day for the same length relief). The active ingredient in each is different as well: Allegra 180mg (the 24 hour extended version) has two active ingredients (fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride); regular Allegra's active ingredient is fexofenadine hydrochloride, and Benadryl's active ingredient is Diphenhydramine. If both work equally well for you, it's probably more economical for yoyou to go with the prescription (if yoyou have health insurance) - the co-pay will be less for a 30 day supply than it would cost for 30 days worth of Over The Counter Benadryl.",

Not the same category as Allegra; it's more like calamine lotion (white stuff often used for poison ivy/oak)."

There I got to try a message bed that has acupuncture and infa-red heating (plus more). After several tryies on this bed, I noticed that I would not smoke for 3 hours after I got a message. I turned to one of my \"Quit Smoking\" guides, and it reccommended messages as a tool to help reduce cravings. I took it another step and tryied \"Hypnosis\". I bet you've seen the adds. . . \"Quit Smoking\" through Hypnosis. So I went, participated in the hypnosis program, & bought the hypnosis tapes. With hypnosis, I did not have migrain headaches like when I used the patch or Zyban, I did not pass-out cold for two days like when I tryed Cold Turkey, and I have not been an angy-tense-emotional person like all of past times I've tryed. It's been 10 days since I've had a cig. . . I go daily for my free message and while I get my message, I listen to my \"Stop Smoking Hypnosis\" Tape plus a extra Hypnosis tape (Deppression, Anger Management, Weight Loss, Memory Improvement, Relationship enhancement for Women, ect). Yoyou probably don't realize that taking away the chemicals in cigaretts can make your memory decrease, or yoyou get depressed. . . but this is part of the big factor of giving up the cig's. . . This is part of the reason why yoyou can't give them up is because there are too many other emotions that stop you. . . So this is why I listen to the other tapes as well. My hypnotic instructor told me to listen to the tapes 2-3 times a day for 21 days (each tape is 20 minutes long). So I spend 40 minutes to 1.5 hours a day practicing to quit smoking. Now, when I smoked, I had 15 cigs a day. Each cig took 10 minutes to smoke. So I spent 2.5 hours a day smoking. So I've actually gained time. 5 days after I quit, I found a pack of cig's with 1 cig (my upside down lucky cig), and I was tempted for 1/100 of a second, and then smashed it and said\" I am a non-smoker\". So basically, my daily message's and hypnosis tapes are working better than any past attempt I've ever tried! I wish yoyou luck, and please wish me luck to stay a non-smoker. Thanks",

One can go for weeks on the same low #. Save those times for when yoyou REALLY crave a cigarette.

This rock is called a fecalith (literally, arock of stool). At other times, the lymphatic tissue in the appendix may swell and block the appendix. Bacteria which normally are found within the appendixthen begin to invade (infect) the wall of the appendix. The body responds to theinvasion by mounting an attack on the bacteria, an attack called inflammation.(An alternative theory for the cause of appendicitis is an initial rupture ofthe appendix followed by spread of bacteria outside the appendix.. The cause ofsuch a rupture is unclear, but it may relate to changes that occur in thelymphatic tissue that line the wall of the appendix.)",

Some individuals require a low blood pressure, while others with a poor heart may be unable to produce a high blood pressure. When blood pressure decreases, the heart rate may increase as a compensatory mechanism to ensure an adequate blood supply to the body. In such circumstances, low blood pressure and high heart rate can be considered normal. However, if low blood pressure results in dizziness, feeling terrible, tiredness, or lethargy, further medical advice may be needed. In general, having both low blood pressure and a high heart rate is not considered normal and could be caused by various factors, with anemia and cardiovascular issues being common contributors."
