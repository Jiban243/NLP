        "answers": [
            "An orgasm, also known as a sexual climax, is a pleasurable physical, psychological or emotional response to prolonged sexual stimulation. It is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks. Dictionaries still give the subsidiary meaning, \"a similar point of intensity of emotional excitement,\" but as of 2005 this usage has become obscure. It can be startling to modern readers when encountered in older literature. General Both males and females can experience orgasm, but the exact response varies across gender. Generally speaking, orgasm is the third stage of four in the human sexual response cycle, which is the currently accepted model of the physiological process of sexual stimulation",
            "Yoyou asked two questions that yoyou might think are the same; but they are not. Orgasm is an experience resulting from the combined effects of physical stimulation, emotional bonding, intellectual intimacy and total surrender or giving to the experience of the moment that crest or climax in overwhelming sensual and spiritual thunderclaps. Many concepts may play a role in building orgasm, including thinking about making a baby, dominance and submission, etc. True love might be a component of a good orgasm, but is itself different and in the long term more fundamental than the orgasm. Having orgasms with someone yoyou love is wonderful, but the existence of the orgasms does not in and of itself serve to indicate whether the relationship will endure over a long term."

        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, an orgasm is a pleasurable response to sexual stimulation, involving physical, emotional, and sometimes spiritual reactions. Both genders can experience it, but the specific response varies. It's the third stage in the human sexual response cycle, influenced by physical touch, emotional connection, mental intimacy, and complete involvement in the moment. Various factors like thoughts of procreation, power dynamics, and genuine love can contribute to the experience. While having orgasms with someone yoyou love can be great, it doesn't guarantee the long-term success of a relationship."

A study of 135 residents of a women's college dorm confirmed the effect. Most of the cycle shifting occurred within the first four months and was usually complete after seven months. Fortunately for the dorm's plumbing, the whole building didn't synchronize, just roommates and close friends. As often as not, the women were unaware of what had happened.

        "answers": [
            "It sure can - read this... it tells yoyou what else can cause ulcers and explains what an ulcer is. My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!): An ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. There are two main types of ulcers- Peptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. How do yoyou know if yoyou have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. Intense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. There may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. There are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. Some medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. Tense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. Although uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. When a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. If yoyou find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. The above is provided for your information, but yoyou are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems. Our information is not medical advice. Yoyou must see your own doctor for medical advice about your gastro esophageal or ulcers.",

Addiction is defined as the compulsive need for and use of something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming, characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal; Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent upon a habit forming substance (such as the endorphins caused by throwing up, or the habit forming behavior of bingeing and the fear of gaining weight that leads to purging/laxatives/exercise in bulimia). What matters most is whether or not the substance or behavior causes what we now know to be the essence of addiction: uncontrollable, compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social consequences. Addicts are trapped in their behaviors and cannot simply quit on their own. They have an illness that requires biomedical treatment. People often assume that because addiction begins with a voluntary behavior and is expressed in the form of excess behavior, an addict should just be able to quit by force of will alone. However, it is essential to understand when dealing with addicts that we are dealing with individuals whose brains have been altered by alcohol, drug or behavioral abuse. They need addiction treatment. Today, scientists and physicians overwhelmingly agree that while use and even abuse of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine is a behavior over which the individual exerts control, addiction to these substances is something different. Scientists have begun to understand why addicted people may sacrifice everything that's important to them -- their jobs, their families, their homes -- in the quest for a fix. Best, `k.",

I know many people who were diagnosed with them and they were nothing. Here's some info from webmd: In particular, they occur in many healthy children, who may or may not outgrow them as adults. They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes. Though many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery. Within the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart. A healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves. Heart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer yoyou to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that yoyou take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when yoyou have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur. Symptoms Many people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms: * Chest pain * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations) * Breathlessness * Fatigue * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects)",

            "DISCLAIMER: Before using any medicines, yoyou should consult a registered physiscian. This is only for information. Acne Treatment |Self-Care at Home| * Wash once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil from the skin. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter in any drug store can also be helpful. Avoid scrubbing too abrasively because this can actually irritate the skin and cause acne to worsen. * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product. * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne. * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne. |Medical Treatment| Many treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor. * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers. o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes. o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles. * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications. o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne. + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender. + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a \"bad sunburn\" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth. o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads). + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil. + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome",

        "answers": [
            "The skin of your fingers absorb water/ fluid and swell also.",
            "The skin of your finger consists of tiny little skin cells, 100's and 100's of millions of them. Each cell is so small yoyou would need a powerful microscope for looking at 100 of them. All cells are surrounded by a membrane. Somewhat like a very, very tiny balloon filled with salty jello. The insides of the outermost cells are salty and dehydrated because your skin grows from underneath, the dermis, close to the capillaries (blood supply). The outer skin, called the epidermis, consists of cells which are wearing out and drying up, although they are mostly not quite dead yet. The very oldest ones that are dead come off when yoyou scrub or shower. Some are falling off all the time, but they are so small yoyou do not see them. Since the epidermis consists of rather dry cells, it is able to absorb water. The cell walls allow the water in your tub, shower, or pool to penetrate into each cell. The insides, being salty, are have a strong affinity for water. If yoyou spend a long time in the water, the epidermal cells swell up, increasing in size, somewhat like the the balloons mentioned earlier being filled with more water. When the skin on the outside of your hands or toes swells it has more surface area than previously. Instead of being like a tight fitting glove, it becomes more like a glove that is too big. If yoyou put on a glove that is too big, it will have wrinkles instead of being stretched smoothly. The entry of water into a cell is called osmosis. If yoyou stay in fresh water for an extremely long time, many cells will absorb so much water they will burst. That is called lysis. Red blood cells are much more fragile than skin cells. When combined with fresh water they rapidly absorb so much water that they all appear to dissolve. Each one of the millions and millions of red blood cells has burst. That is called hemolysis. Ropes made from plant fibers are also composed of cells. Test a rope: See if it shrinks in length when absorbing water or drying out. When the skin on your fingers and toes dries out, the cells shrink in size, and the skin becomes more smooth and taut, like a tight, well fitted glove. Your skin is very important. Without it yoyou would be just like a raw piece of meat, ready for the flies and germs to eat. Take good care of your skin. Do not get sunburned. When yoyou have a bad cut that is healing, yoyou should try to keep your hands out of dirty water or ponds. These contain potentially dangerous bacteria that could infect your open or healing wound. Taking a shower or washing your hands in clean water is okay. Just be sure to put antibiotic ointment and a fresh bandage over the cut when yoyou are done. Your teacher might be able to show yoyou some pictures of bacteria (germs) or let yoyou look at live ones through a microscope. Only one person is allowed to look through at a time. Everyone else must stand back and not push the observer or touch their head. Otherwise yoyou could injure one of their eyes or both by knocking them into the eyepiece or binoculars of the microscope. Some people have gone blind that way. No horsing around ! Strictly enforced. During winter, good skin care means putting lotion on your hands and wearing gloves while outside in the cold winter air.

Reducing the saturated fats will lower blood cholesterol and may (I'm not promising anything!) make the stones smaller. Lowering your total fat intake may also help reduce or prevent pain. Gallstones hurt because when yoyou eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat. If yoyou have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks. However... I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal. There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit. If yoyou leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing!",

            "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is normally associated with macular degeneration. Most of the time, this occurs when new blood vessels grow through cracks in tissue layers beneath the retina called Bruch's membrane. As CNV progresses, the abnormal vessels may leak fluid and bleed. Eventually this process causes damage to the overlying retina. Decreased and/or distorted vision will often occur. As for the cause in a newborn, I would guess that it would be an inherited eye disease.",
            "I think that yoyou mean CMV, cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the herpes virus group of infections. Like herpes, it is inactive at times, but it is incurable and is a life-time infection. CMV may be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and is the most common congenital viral infection. It is also called congenital cytomegalovirus or cytomegalovirus inclusion disease. CMV without symptoms is common in babies and young children. It is found in saliva, urine, semen, and other body fluids. The virus is easily spread in households and in daycare centers. It can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during delivery or in breast milk. Over half of women of childbearing age become infected with CMV at least six months before becoming pregnant. There appear to be few risks for complications of CMV for this group and only a few babies have the infection at birth. These babies appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities. About 90 percent of babies who are infected with CMV have no symptoms at birth. But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities \u2014 such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss \u2014 usually in the first year or two of life. Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of hearing loss in children. About one in 1,000 babies (about 4,000 babies each year) shows symptoms of CMV at birth. These symptoms may include an enlarged spleen or liver, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a distinctive rash. Up to 20 percent of these babies die, and about 90 percent of the survivors suffer from serious neurological defects, such as mental retardation. At present there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the effects of congenital CMV. However, doctors are investigating whether a new antiviral drug called ganciclovir \u2014 which is used to treat adults with AIDS who have CMV-related eye infections \u2014 also may help babies with congenital CMV."

Bacteria on your hands or on unsterile equipment can lead to more blemishes and possible scarring. 4. Steam your face once or twice a week to help open the pores. Boil water, remove the pot from the stove, drape a towel over your head and hold your face over the pot. Then rinse your face with cold water. 5. Use essential oils such as calendula, chamomile, juniper, lavendar and mint directly on your skin. Mix 10 drops of any of the oils with 2 tbsp. soy or almond oil, and smooth a few drops on dampened skin. 6. Try using herbs. Saw palmetto can help balance boys' hormones, while chaste tree berry can do the same for girls. Echinacea, alfalfa, burdock root, cayenne, chaparral and yellow dock root are also helpful. 7. Consider other topical mixtures. Beat an egg yolk, apply it with a cotton ball and leave it on for 15 minutes. Alternatively, mix oatmeal and honey together to form a paste and apply it to your face. Oatmeal soaks up excess oil and honey soothes the skin. 8. Take acidophilus to fight bacteria. 9. Eat a diet high in fiber, including whole grains and fresh vegetables and fruits, to keep your body healthy overall and provide nutrients to your skin.

Sexual dysfunction is an interesting one because many times the cause is something physical.

Dysfunction is one of the leading indicators that there are other things going on that need to be checked out. If every thing is ok and yoyou want a little boost, hypnosis can be great. Doing it with your partner can be wonderful. Much of hypnosis is about belief and trust. Making the avenues of communication and trust stronger between partners will always help. In the case of inhibition, hypnosis is not mind control. It can't be use to make yoyou do something that yoyou don't want to do. It can be used to make yoyou more comfortable with an idea that yoyou chose to explore. It can be use to help yoyou explore why yoyou are uncomfortable with a subject and if these inhibitions are something yoyou want to modify.

If a person has an issue due to who is in control, why would he (or how would he be able to) sit in a chair and allow someone else to reprogram his mind? Not everyone can be hypnotized, anyway. Certain people are simply resistant to others tampering with their brains. I'm not any kind of therapist, but I certainly don't suggest hypnotherapy. People should work out their problems while they are in control of themselves, and take responsibility for their own actions. And suppose the hypnotherapy doesn't work? Is it the hypnotist's fault? No, but some people would use that excuse. And besides, even if the hypnotherapy did work, you're still only putting a band-aid on the issue, because you're only concentrating on the sexual dysfunction.

            "A \"cold\" (runny nose, sinus drainage, sneezing, miserable feeling) is called acute rhinitis. It's a inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat and is caused by a virus. There are many viruses that cause head-colds (acute rhinitis) and simply not being warm (no coat, gloves, etc) will not cause yoyou to have acute rhinitis. Yoyou must be exposed to the virus before yoyou can \"catch a cold.\" Sneezing causes airborne particles. Someone who sneezes and has the virus can allow yoyou to get the a cold. Touching someone or something that has a virus on it can cause yoyou to get a cold (acute rhinitis). The virus enters your body by way of your eye, nose, or mouth. Hand-washing is an excellent way to minimize the chance you'll catch a cold.",
            "Both. Yes, yoyou do get colds from airborn or surface viruses. However, your mother is right because being cold will lower your resistance and your immune system.",
            "Research has shown that being \"cold\" does not make yoyou more susceptible to colds. I put cold in quotes because cold is a relative term. For instance, Mom is cold at 72 degrees and that's just too hot for me. In the research that has been done, \"cold\" is usually around 40 degrees with their feet in cold water. Even spending quite a bit of time like this, people were still no more likely to catch a cold when directly exposed to cold germs. Another reason I point out the relativity of being cold. This idea has been around a long, long time. When I read books written in the 1800s, the characters will talk about breaking the ice that had formed on the bedside water pitcher. These people were sleeping in temperatures far colder than most people in developed countries can even conceive of. Still, it does seem like people get more colds during winter. It should be noted that this is the same whether yoyou are in Chicago or LA. It's possible that germs like it a touch cooler than we do, or it's possible we simply stay inside more, which leads to a greater chance of being exposed to other peoples colds (also, there's a lot more travelling and socializing in November/December - yet more chances to catch a cold). It could be that a good number of cases of colds are just \"cold stress\" - a reaction our bodies have to sudden changes in weather. I know that my nose will run whenever we get a cold front come through. We have no real data, even on whether there really are more colds in the winter. So it's hard to tell why we get more colds during the winter. But getting cold doesn't seem to be that much of a culprit.",
            "When yoyou are cold, your body can't protect itself as well from illness because it turns its attention to protecting yoyou from the cold itself. If yoyou wear the hat and gloves and coat, when yoyou are exposed to germs in the air and on surfaces, yoyou will be more able to fight it off before it makes yoyou really ill."

While being cold itself does not directly make yoyou more susceptible to colds, there is a correlation between colder weather and an increase in colds, possibly due to factors such as spending more time indoors and increased exposure to others' colds.

An inguinal hernia occurs in the groin (the area between the abdomen and thigh). It is called \"inguinal\" because the intestines push through a weak spot in the inguinal canal, which is a triangle-shaped opening between layers of abdominal muscle near the groin. Obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining to pass stool can cause the intestine to push against the inguinal canal. Symptoms of inguinal hernia may include a lump in the groin near the thigh; pain in the groin; and, in severe cases, partial or complete blockage of the intestine. The doctor diagnoses hernia by doing a physical exam and by taking x rays and blood tests to check for blockage in the intestine. The main treatment for inguinal hernia is surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty. If the protruding intestine becomes twisted or traps stool, part of the intestine might need to be removed. This surgery is called bowel resection.

It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen. From webmd: Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition. In scleroderma, the skin gradually tightens and thickens or hardens. It loses its ability to stretch.

        "question": "what is aortic valve replacement?",
        "answers": [
            "it replaces one of the valves in your heart (which function to move the blood to the rest of the body from the heart) to improve blood flow.",
            "The aortic valve is the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta. This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body. There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart. There are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves. Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile. The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life. Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients. However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life. There is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure. This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve. The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve. The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve. The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable. In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation. Current cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices.",
            "The aortic valve is a semilunar valve that controls blood flow from the left ventricle to the systemic system of the body.. Its only job is to close so that backflow of blood back to the left ventricle will not be attained.. If the valve is not functioning properly the person's diastolic pressure will increase which will ultimately cause a cardiac infarction. The actual replacement can be achieved, but it is a very delicate surgery because the aorta is the biggest blood vessel in the body. Usually an aortic bypass is performed."
        ],
        "labelled_summary": "For information purposes, the aortic valve serves as the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta, facilitating the flow of fresh oxygenated blood throughout the body. Diseases such as aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency may necessitate the replacement of this valve. There are two primary types of aortic valve replacements: mechanical valves, which have a well-established safety record but require lifelong blood thinners, and biologic/tissue valves, which eliminate the need for blood thinners but may have lower durability. The Ross procedure presents a variation, replacing the aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve and using a tissue valve for the pulmonary position. This approach minimizes strain on the aortic valve and avoids the need for postoperative blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive catheter-based methods for valve replacement. Proper functioning of the aortic valve is crucial to prevent complications such as increased diastolic pressure and the risk of cardiac infarction. Aortic bypass surgery is often performed to address a malfunctioning aortic valve, acknowledging the complexity of the procedure due to the aorta's significance as the body's largest blood vessel."

In 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain. Recent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS"

            "hey i read this somewher, that matches the symptons here: PFIC (Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis) What is Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) Taken word for word, it means: Progressive: tending to get worse over time; Familial: passed down to a child from the parents by way of the genes; Intrahepatic: involves disease inside the liver and not the bile ducts outside the liver; Cholestasis: means poor bile flow and build-up of substances in the liver that should be put into bile. The symptoms of PFIC FIC1 and BSEP disease cause similar symptoms; together they are called low-GGT PFIC because of a blood test (GGT) that is low rather than high as in most other forms of cholestasis. These diseases cause cholestasis that begins in early childhood, with the average age at onset being 3 months. However, some patients do not get symptoms of cholestasis until they are teenagers or young adults. These diseases can progress quickly to bad scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) in the first year of life or more slowly with minimal scarring well into the teenage years. Few patients have survived beyond 20 years without treatment. Itching (pruritus) is the main symptom of cholestasis in many patients. Pruritus is often out of proportion to the level of jaundice (yellow eyes or skin), which is often low-grade and can wax and wane. Scratching starts as digging at the ears and eyes, which are the first areas to show bleeding and scarring. The itching may be very disabling and does not usually respond to medications. The scratching interferes with normal activities and sleep and may interfere with learning and schoolwork. Problems with growth are another major feature of PFIC. Almost all patients are short for their age, but they may not be thin. Delayed puberty and sexual development is common. Patients who are treated can have normal sexual development and several have given birth to normal children. Other common problems include frequent nosebleeds and wheezing. Fat-soluble vitamin (A, E, D and K) deficiencies are common in untreated patients. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to problems with vision. Vitamin E deficiency can lead to problems with balance, strength and coordination. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to poor bone formation. Vitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding problems. For these reasons, most patients need extra vitamins. Up to a third of patients have gallstones. Most patients have an enlarged liver or enlarged spleen. Although similar, there are differences between patients with BSEP disease and those with FIC1 disease. For example, patients with FIC1 disease are more likely to have watery diarrhea, which can be severe, especially after liver transplantation. However, there is much that we do not yet know about these differences and this will only become clear as more patients are studied. Patients with PFIC but with high serum GGT have been called PFIC3, and are now called MDR3 disease. These patients have very bad cholestasis in the first year of life, which may progress in the first few years of life toward failure of the liver to do its normal functions. However, there are probably less severe forms of MDR3 disease that cause milder disease. The child and his family may first become aware that there is something wrong during school age or adolescence. Sometimes, problems may not appear until adulthood. The full spectrum of liver problems caused by MDR3 disease is just now becoming known."

        "labelled_summary": "Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is a genetic disorder characterized by worsening cholestasis, a condition involving poor bile flow and the accumulation of substances in the liver. PFIC can be categorized as low-GGT PFIC when associated with FIC1 and BSEP diseases, leading to symptoms such as jaundice, itching (pruritus), and liver scarring (cirrhosis). Onset typically occurs in early childhood but can manifest later into adolescence or adulthood. Itching, often disproportionate to jaundice levels, is a prominent symptom and may be resistant to medications. Growth issues, delayed puberty, frequent nosebleeds, and vitamin deficiencies are common. Patients may also experience gallstones, an enlarged liver, and spleen. PFIC3, now referred to as MDR3 disease, involves severe cholestasis in early life and may progress to liver dysfunction. Variations in symptoms exist between FIC1 disease and BSEP disease, and MDR3 disease may present with milder forms. The understanding of these disorders is evolving as more patients are studied."

I also recommend \"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway\" by Susan Jeffers. It teaches yoyou to repeat \"I'll Handle It\", which is very helpful during a panic attack.

            "Panic attacks are extremely frightening and often very disabling. Suggested methods for overcoming them depend on vairous factors including - how frequent the attacks are, what disruption they cause in your life and whether they are associated with any particular situation. If your panic attacks are repititive and frequent yoyou may have consulted a mental health professional. Psychological therapies and medication are the two main methods used. Psychological therapies like relaxation training and Exposure and response prevention aim at recognition and working through a panic attack, so that they eventually decrease in frequency. Medication is used if psychological therapies do not work, if the attacks are very severe or in conjunction with psychological treatment. Common ones have included antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, venlafaxine etc. I would steer clear of benzos as they may be habit forming and one quickly gets habituated to their actions. In the end the best person to contact may be your psychiatrist or psychologist. I have no knowledge of any other methods though they exist and information is available on the web.",
            "I have had panic attacks also. I would highly recommend trying several natural strategies before doing any prescription medication. There is a great book called \"Natural Relief for Anxiety: Complementary Strategies for Easing Fear, Panic & Worry\" that outlines various strategies. First, one of the most immediate things yoyou can do is to cut out caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and any drugs. These things obviously disrupt any physical and mental balances. Second, exercise exercise exercise. There is a lot of scientific data that says *vigorous* exercise can really be the most effective way to clean up your head and also strengthen your heart. Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks. Third, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If yoyou can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time. Fourth, when yoyou actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over \"Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon.\" As yoyou repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds. Do this sequence 20 times in a row. It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic). Fifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you. Sixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders. Yoyou will need to find out what is the root cause of your panic ... that is, what exactly are yoyou so afraid of? People do conquer panic attacks. Yoyou can do it!"

It occurs when the adrenal glands, seated above the kidneys, fail to produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, sometimes, the hormone aldosterone. Addison's disease refers specifically to primary adrenal insufficiency, in which the adrenal glands themselves malfunction; secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland does not produce enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to adequately stimulate the adrenal glands.",

Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where yoyou need it can be under-treated. Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if yoyou start raising the dosage. There is a solution- topical administration. Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream. It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine). Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded. Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that yoyou can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems. Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs. Yoyou may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. When yoyou apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes. This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area. Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.

            "In order to be succeed at thinning your waistline, yoyou have to get a basic under standing of how the abdominal muscles function and how your body burns fat. The first thing that yoyou need to understand is the difference between fat and muscle tissue. Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement. Fat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But yoyou can lose muscle mass while yoyou gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older. So if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing yoyou need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. The most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep yoyou from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). Yoyou have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often yoyou will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. If yoyou want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles yoyou need to incorporate these exercises: 1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.) 1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.) 1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.) Your abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. Yoyou also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time. Increase metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more! This means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! Here's a simple interval workout that yoyou can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc). Warm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes Perform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible) perform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath) Repeat this process from 6-10 times Cool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes Maintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, yoyou have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off! To stabilize your blood sugar level yoyou have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would yoyou only feed it once or twice a day? Give your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). Most people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn\u2019t matter where they come from. If there\u2019s extra it's going to body fat! I'm not saying that what yoyou eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn\u2019t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat. Make healthy choices whenever possible, but don\u2019t feel like every cheeseburger yoyou eat is guaranteed to be st",

In the United States, approximately 10,000 people are diagnosed with schizophrenia each year, and currently, 2.2 million Americans suffer from the illness. While schizophrenia occurs with equal frequency in men and women, it often manifests earlier in men, typically in the late teens or early twenties, compared to women who are generally affected in their twenties to early thirties. Individuals with schizophrenia may experience distressing symptoms such as hearing internal voices, delusions, and paranoia, leading to fear and withdrawal. Treatment options exist to alleviate many symptoms, but it's estimated that no more than one in five individuals with schizophrenia fully recovers. Notably, misdiagnoses with conditions like ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, and other emotional disturbances are common among children, adding complexity to accurate identification and treatment."

            "Constipation, infrequent or irregular bowel movements, is no fun for anyone. It can be painful and uncomfortable. Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness. Fortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation. Since dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It\u2019s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation. A healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem. Regular exercise will also assist in one\u2019s quest for regularity. Even if it\u2019s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important. If you\u2019re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help. Laxatives \u2013 There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone\u2019s personal preference. If you\u2019re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. Lemon and Honey \u2013 Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. Orange Juice and Olive Oil \u2013 Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. Licorice \u2013 Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. Grapes \u2013 A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. Castor oil and honey \u2013 Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. Something else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great! When it comes to constipation, the important thing is to have a proper diet, drink water often throughout the day, and exercise on a regular basis. If your constipation lasts for longer than a week, contact your physician. In the meantime, why not try one of the above remedies?",

        "question": "Chinese Green Tea Benefits?",
        "answers": [
            "There are three types of tea Black, Oolong, and Green tea. The difference between the Green tea and the others is that green tea is not fermented, thus keeping in the powerful antioxidants lost in the fermenting process. Green tea also contains polyphenols such as tannins (a nutrient antioxidant) catchins (EGCG which is a powerful antioxidant), and flavenoids, as well as other vitamins and minerals, such as Vitamin C. The antioxidants help your body fight against free radicals, which can mutate cells and make yoyou sick. Numerous scientific discoveries have also linked green tea with remarkable disease preventative properties. Gargling with green tea has been shown to inactivate the flyou virus, as has drinking a cup each day to activate the polyphenols (powerful antioxidants) that are also suspected to work well against both the cold and flyou viri. As China permits greater access to its interior to scientists, reports grow of entire villages in the green tea growing regions where cancers and sicknesses are statistically lower than the national norm. Though such studies are best classified as emergent, green tea is becoming widely viewed as one of the superfoods of the future. Here are just a few known health benefits of drinking green tea: Boosts your immune system Lowers blood sugar Helps prevent cavities and tooth decay Slows the aging process Helps reduce the risk of cancer Lowers cholesterol Aids in weight loss by burning calories Reduces high blood pressure Prevents arthritis Reduces the risk of heart disease Reduces the risk of stroke Lowers the risk of blood clot Anti-Cancer Compound In Green Tea Identified Researchers at the University of Murcia in Spain (UMU) and the John Innes Center (JIC) in Norwich, England have shown that a compound called EGCG in green tea prevents cancer cells from growing by binding to a specific enzyme. \"We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs, \" Professor Roger Thorneley, of JIC, told Reuters. It does \"Aid in weight loss by burning calories\" Popular brands include Tazo, Stash, Bigelow and Pacific Chai. Yoyou can buy it here: http://www.green-tea-benefits.com/shopping.html"

Avoiding the use of alcohol and sedatives before bed. Quitting smoking. Raising the head of your bed 4 in. (10 cm) to 6 in.

        "question": "please explain about types of leukemia?",
        "answers": [
            "There are several types of leukemia. They are grouped in two ways. One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected. Leukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually. Leukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia. These are the most common types of leukemia: 1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. 2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). 3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. 4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. 5.Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. This and other uncommon types of leukemia are not discussed here.

Drowsiness and apathy (a feeling of indifference or not caring about what happens) can be symptoms of fatigue. Fatigue can be a normal and important response to physical exertion, emotional stress, boredom, or lack of sleep. However, it can also be a nonspecific sign of a more serious psychological or physical disorder. Fatigue that is not relieved by enough sleep, good nutrition, or a low-stress environment should be evaluated by your doctor. Because fatigue is a common complaint, sometimes a potentially serious cause may be overlooked. The pattern of fatigue may help your doctor determine its underlying cause. For example, if yoyou wake up in the morning rested but rapidly develop fatigue with activity, yoyou may have an ongoing physical condition like an underactive thyroid. On the other hand, if yoyou wake up with a low level of energy and have fatigue that lasts throughout the day, yoyou may be depressed. ======================== Do yoyou have any underlying illnesses? Is your thyroid funcioning correctly? Are yoyou sleeping soundly? Each of these can lead to fatigue.

It can be an allergic reaction - if you're having other symptoms of allergies like watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, then it could just be an extension of whatever you're allergic to. But hives can be brought on by heat without an allergic reaction. Nobody knows for sure why it happens in the absence of other allergies. But heat brings blood to the surface of the skin and allows hives to develop. If yoyou scratch them, they will spread. Sometimes mine itch when they're just flat red wheals, and sometimes they don't... but if I so much as touch a wheal before it swells, POOF! Not only does it swell and itch a lot worse, but it tells all its friends and neighbors, and it spreads like wildfire. I have had chronic hives for 6 months now - due to allergies. I take a Claritin and a Singulair every day, and it still doesn't completely get rid of them. I am undergoing allergy shots. One other thing yoyou can do is to get some Ivarest. Yoyou can find it at Walgreens. I've tried everything else on the market, and only Ivarest keeps the hives down for longer than an hour or so. It's a little more expensive, but a tube will last me several weeks, instead of just a day or two like a tube of Benadryl cream. Yoyou can also take Benadryl before a shower to help keep the hives down to a minimum. If yoyou don't get relief of them within about six weeks, go to the doctor and get tested for allergies.",

        "answers": [
            "It is a infectious disease-mostly kids get--with a rash on feet, hands and mouth--it goes away in about 14 days--no big deal",
            "What is \"fifth disease?\" Fifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days. What causes fifth disease? Fifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child. Can adults get fifth disease? Yes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease. Is fifth disease contagious? Yes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash. How does someone get infected with parvovirus B19? Parvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease. How soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill? A susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection. Does everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill? No. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future. How is fifth disease diagnosed? A physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection. Is fifth disease serious? Fifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability. Parvovirus B19 infection may cause a serious"

The aim of reiki is to promote health, maintain well-being, and help people attain a higher consciousness. Practitioners draw on \"reiki energy\" channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients. They borrow terminology from physics, claiming that reiki acts at an atomic level, causing the body's molecules to vibrate with higher intensity and thus dissolving energy blockages that lead to disharmony and disease. A treatment session lasts about an hour; the practitioner directs reike energy through his hands to the patient. The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each. This is said to balance the body's energy centers or \"chakras.\" Some patients may feel relaxed after treatment; others feel invigorated.\" To get in touch with your own energy body as a beginner, I recommend T'ai Chi. Yoyou can find classes at the YMCA or, sometimes, through the adult education programs in American cities.",

There are also variations between groups within single countries. For example, in the US in the early 20th century there were very large differences in life expectancy between people of different races, which have since lessened. There remain significant differences in life expectancy between men and women in the US and other developed countries, with women outliving men. These differences by sex have been reducing in recent years, with men's life expectancy improving at a faster rate than women's. Poverty and inequality has a very substantial effect on life expectancy. In the United Kingdom life expectancy in the wealthiest areas is ten years longer than the poorest areas and the gap appears to be increasing as life expectancy for the prosperous continues to increase while in more deprived communities there is little increase. (Department of Health -[Tackling health inequalities]: Status report on the Programme for Action Air pollution may also reduce life expectancy, especially for those living near busy roads, due to the exhaust fumes from cars. Occupation may also have a major effect on life expectancy. Well-educated professionals working in offices have a high life expectancy, while asbestos and coal miners do not.

No birth control method is 100% effective except abstinence. It used to be thought that pregnancy couldn't occur during menstruation, which is not true. Unusually high libido may indicate hormonal changes favoring fertility. Approximately two weeks before and after a regular period, especially around day 14 (with day 1 being the first day of the period), is considered a high probability time for conception. However, any time of the month is possible, so relying solely on timing for birth control is not recommended. Day 12-18 poses a higher risk due to the viability of sperm lasting a few days. Temperature measurement or other methods can be used to track ovulation for more accurate predictions."

If that doesn't make yoyou stop - Let me remind yoyou that yoyou are also damaging anyone who happens to be in the room with yoyou while yoyou are smoking. Second hand smoke has been proven to be as damaging as first hand. Quit smoking and people will want to be with yoyou more often. Not only that yoyou will smell better, breathe better and certainly like yourself better. Plus yoyou will save a lot of money as another side benefit. Good luck. Hope you'll give it your best shot.

Its cuz the muscles arent big enough to show a 6 pack. There was never enough resistance to get it. I dont recommend any type of sit ups. I do a kung fyou style push up that gives yoyou the best results. Imagine, everybody can do like 10 or 20, maybe 100 sit ups, but with this, some cannot even do one. But, just because yoyou cant do one doesnt mean yoyou havent done any work. Eventually, after trying every day, yoyou will be able to do one. And then 2, 3, and slowly yoyou work your way to like 25. Yoyou only need to do about 15 to 20 per day to keep that 6 pack after its there. Yoyou lay flat on the floor on your stomach. Then yoyou prop your feet up in push up position. Now yoyou put your hands out there on the floor. Now put them together so that they are just touching. Now, try to do a push up. Keep your back as straight as possible. When yoyou first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because yoyou are trying to do at least one. Hehe. Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy. After I get it, it was a cinch. It will take yoyou like 1 to 2 minutes a day trying to do like 20. Thats all it takes to keep your 6 pack. I used to do crunches. Elbows to knees. They arent bad, but this is far better. Because doing crunches, yoyou might not be able to sit on the floor with your legs out, and lift your body with your two hands without touching the floor. With these push ups, after yoyou get the hang of it, yoyou can lift yourself off the ground, with your legs parallel to the ground. This is when yoyou know that yoyou are on your way. Its the fastest, the best, and the only one that pin points right at your stomach. Good luck. Once there, yoyou will need to work a difference excercise for that 8 pack. People dont say 8 because they dont believe it exists. It does, and I have it. I will assist further when yoyou are ready. Just make sure yoyou rate me hehee...",

Others contend that traditional sit-ups, when performed correctly, can contribute to core strength. However, the notion that sit-ups alone are a waste of time for revealing a six-pack highlights the importance of combining abdominal exercises with an overall fitness strategy, including resistance training, cardiovascular exercise, and a healthy diet, to address both muscle development and body fat reduction."

So working out 24 hours a day as stated above is pure stupidity. also 3X 20 sets is another stupid answer which will lead to what i already stated above. now here is the way to build muscle properly and increase the speed in which yoyou will gain them: the secret to gaining muscle is to shock your muscles every work out. this can be done in the following ways: -changing the order of the exercise each work out - changing the speed at which yoyou lift the weights, slow or faster -super sets which means doing two or more opposite or same body part exercises - giant sets which means no rest between all sets performed for a specific body part - negatives which means lowering the weight very slowly after one rep - stripping which means lifting the heaviest weight yoyou can to muscle failure (when yoyou can lift it anymore) for no more than 6-8 repetitions and then going to a slightly lower weight + repeat that's only a few ways to shock your muscles into growing. Muscles have a memory so yoyou must vary and change your routine and shocking methods constantly. also there is the diet component: proteins: make sure yoyou eat a palm size protein portion every meal, which should be every 3 hours that yoyou arent sleeping and do not eatt 3 hours before going to bed to prevent food from metabolizing into fat. carbs: 2 clenched fists is the ideal portion fats: olive oils, flaxseed oils, peanuts, almonds, no more than 10-12 or a table spoon per meal for the oils make sure yoyou do not work the same muscle groups within 48 hours or 2 days to give them time to recover and grow. make sure yoyou sleep at least 8 hours, as much of the recovery occurs during sleep. make sure yoyou eat no more than 1 hour after your work outs make sure yoyou have a protein shake before going to bed, no other food if possible throw junk food, alcohol, and other tempting food in the garbage. keep your training to 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions per exercise@ 3 exercises per body part any more question, visit this excellent site bellow, and good luck",

            "Gynaecology is a typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option. As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination. Investigations Some of the investigations used in gynaecology are: abdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. vaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. blood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. hysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. laparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. MRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle. Diseases The main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are: cancer of the cervix. The Papanicolaoyou (Pap) smear is a means of detecting this, by obtaining a sample of cervical epithelial cells and examining them under a microscope for malignant changes. All women are encouraged to have pap smears at regular intervals after commencing intercourse. incontinence of urine. amenorrhoea (absent periods) dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) infertility menorrhagia (heavy periods). This is a main indication for hysterectomy. prolapse Obviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist.",

And then there's genetics. If there are a lot of heavier people in her family then chances are she's gonna be heavier too no matter what she does. And then her metabolism also plays a factor. If her metabolism is slow then she's just gonna be heavier. But if she's only 5 feet tall then hopefully she's not TOO heavy. Because that could cause heart problems for her.

It was first identified in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s and is now known to exist worldwide. A strain of the H5N1-type of avian influenzavirus that emerged in 1997 has been identified as the most likely source of a future influenza pandemic and is known to have infected 133 people in Asia since late 2003, killing 68.[1] The avian influenza subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human deaths, are: H1N1 caused Spanish flu, H2N2 caused Asian Flu, H3N2 caused Hong Kong Flu, H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, H7N3.",

The particular strain of influenza which has been reported as causing the deaths is called H5N1. Humans can contract the disease through close contact with infected birds, or with the feces of infected birds. It is not known to spread through human-to-human contact. There has been no indication that humans would get the disease through eating eggs or meat of sick birds. The only known way to eradicate the disease is by culling infected flocks. Thus far millions of chickens, ducks and other kinds of poultry have been culled in an effort to eliminate the virus. There have been several deaths due to the flyou and the World Health Organization has expressed concern that the virus could latch on to a human influenza virus, potentially causing a serious epidemic.

Eradication involves culling infected flocks, and millions of poultry have been culled to contain the virus. There is concern that the virus could potentially combine with a human influenza virus, leading to a serious epidemic. Human symptoms include fever, coughing, and, in severe cases, pneumonia."

            "The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets (the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth. Your dentist would measure this with a probe. If your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that yoyou have had bone loss which is usually caused by periodontal disease (an infection in the gums). The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly (brush at least twice a day for two minutes). I emphasize flossing, because often people don't realize just how important it is. The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck, and therefore where bacteria sticks most often, too. The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch. So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth, yoyou want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure yoyou remove the plaque. So yoyou should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact. Hope this helps!"

            "Yoyou have several options to treat your Vertigo. Because Vertigo is not a disease, Vertigo treatment and Vertigo remedies depend upon diagnosing the underlying cause. Once the cause is identified, doctors may choose from among these Vertigo treatment options: Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a physical therapy-based Vertigo treatment. It is designed to reduce the effects of Vertigo symptoms by introducing the patient to a series of exercises for Vertigo. Successful Vertigo treatment using this method is said to improve balance and prevent falls by helping to restore functionality to the vestibular system. VRT is not always successful. Major considerations that must be addressed when deciding upon this particular Vertigo treatment include: The patient's age The ability of the patient to remember and follow directions. The general physical and mental health of the patient The patient's physical strength Vertigo Medication If the underlying causes of Vertigo are diagnosed to be an ear infections that is caused by the presence of bacteria, the the doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. The problem with taking these types of antibiotics, other than the expense of the prescription, is that they have produced side effects in many people including allergic reaction like shortness of breath; throat closure; hives; facial, lips and tongue swelling, seizures, severe watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some patients have even reported unusual bleeding. A type of Vertigo known as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, which is believed to be caused by a calcium buildup in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, is frequently treated with a drug called meclizine or Antivert. Side effects of this Vertigo medication may include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision. When meclizine does not work, the doctor will try certain benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, or antihistamines such as promethazine. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, and tremors. Vertigo Surgery If the Vertigo symptoms are caused by an ear infection, and those infections become chronic, the doctor may opt to perform a surgical procedure whereby an incision is made in the eardrum and a small tube is placed in the incision which prevents fluid and bacteria from building up inside of the ear.

The text emphasizes the body's use of skin to release toxins, with a recommendation to evaluate and improve dietary choices. It suggests avoiding processed foods due to their chemical content and advocates for inner body cleansing, starting with colonics and seeking herbalist assistance.

            "A hiccup or hiccough (generally pronounced \"hiccup\" independent of the spelling) is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm; typically this repeats several times a minute. The sudden rush of air into the lungs causes the glottis to close, creating the \"hic\" noise. A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term \"hiccup\" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus. While many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors.",
            "Irrition to your diaphragm causes hiccups. The diaphragn pulls down when yoyou inhale to help pull air into the lungs, and it pushes up when yoyou exhale to help push air out of the lungs. But when your diaphragm gets irritated it pushes up in a jerky way causing a hiccup.",
            "Hiccups are sudden, involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle. As the muscle contracts repeatedly, the opening between your vocal cords snaps shut to check the inflow of air and makes the hiccup sound. Irritation of the nerves that extend from the neck to the chest can cause hiccups."

        "labelled_summary": "Hiccups, also known as singultus in medical terms, are involuntary spasms of the diaphragm, typically occurring repeatedly within a minute. The abrupt intake of air during a hiccup causes the glottis to close, resulting in the distinctive \"hic\" sound. While hiccups often resolve on their own, various home remedies exist to expedite their cessation, and in some cases, medication may be required. The term \"hiccup\" is also metaphorically used to describe minor deviations in an otherwise consistent pattern. These spasms can be triggered by diverse factors such as eating too quickly, consuming hot or spicy foods, laughing vigorously, or drinking excessively. Hiccups may also arise from anatomical pressure on the phrenic nerve or, rarely, due to tumors. Irritation to the diaphragm, a muscle aiding in breathing, is the underlying cause of hiccups. When irritated, the diaphragm contracts involuntarily, causing the vocal cords to snap shut and produce the hiccup sound.

Some diets limit the amount of overall carbohydrate, while others focus on certain types of foods, generally ones high in starch and sugars, such as the \u201cNo White Foods\u201d approach. Still others focus on how glycemic the diet is. It\u2019s important not to equate \u201clow carb\u201d with the very low carb phase of some popular diets.

Constant wetting and drying sucks the moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which prompts more licking, creating a vicious cycle. Dehydrated lips are also more susceptible to dry, windy conditions. -- A moisturizing lip balm, especially those containing dimethicone, will help retain natural moisture and protect dry, chapped lips. -- Drinking lots of water will help prevent dehydration, which may contribute to chapped lips and dry skin. -- Smoothing a generous coating of lip balm on lips before bed will help to moisturize lips while yoyou sleep. -- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. -- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. -- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips. Also keep acidic foods from touching delicate lips until they've healed. -- Lip exfoliators such as Softlips Nightly Care(TM) buff away dry, dead skin cells and stimulate growth of new, vibrant cells. The interactive Beta Hydroxy formula of Softlips Nightly Care(TM) conditions lips that may be sensitive to strong Alpha Hydroxy chemical peels, and the overnight system helps reduce concern about sun damage to freshly exfoliated skin.

            "Causes of HIV/AIDS Cause of HIV/AIDS: AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By killing or damaging cells of the body's immune system, HIV progressively destroys the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers. People diagnosed with AIDS may get life-threatening diseases called opportunistic infections, which are caused by microbes such as viruses or bacteria that usually do not make healthy people sick. 1 Cause statistics for HIV/AIDS: The following are statistics from various sources about the causes of HIV/AIDS: 57.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through sex with other men in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 24% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 9.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 38% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) 59% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) Cause details for HIV/AIDS: HIV disease is characterized by a gradual deterioration of immune function. Most notably, crucial immune cells called CD4+ T cells are disabled and killed during the typical course of infection. These cells, sometimes called \"T-helper cells,\" play a central role in the immune response, signaling other cells in the immune system to perform their special functions. A healthy, uninfected person usually has 800 to 1,200 CD4+ T cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood. During HIV infection, the number of these cells in a person's blood progressively declines. When a person's CD4+ T cell count falls below 200/mm3, he or she becomes particularly vulnerable to the opportunistic infections and cancers that typify AIDS, the end stage of HIV disease. People with AIDS often suffer infections of the lungs, intestinal tract, brain, eyes and other organs, as well as debilitating weight loss, diarrhea, neurologic conditions and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and certain types of lymphomas. Most scientists think that HIV causes AIDS by directly inducing the death of CD4+ T cells or interfering with their normal function, and by triggering other events that weaken a person's immune function. For example, the network of signaling molecules that normally regulates a person's immune response is disrupted during HIV disease, impairing a person's ability to fight other infections. The HIV-mediated destruction of the lymph nodes and related immunologic organs also plays a major role in causing the immunosuppression seen in people with AIDS.

Physical reasons might be that the part of your body may be too tight to allow for good circulation. In this case, yoyou must stretch (eg. yoga or pilates) and exercise to loosen up that area. Doing heat pack will also help to aid the blood flow temporarily. One important thing to remember though is that the source of tightness might be completely unexpected. If yoyou have cold hands, it may be more helpful to stretch your calves or your shoulders depending on your body structure rather than the hand itself. Yoyou must remember to treat your body as a whole. Chemical reasons could come from your diet or the air yoyou breathe or any other intake (eg. tobacco or drugs). This could alter the chemical make up of your bloodstream. In this case, what yoyou would have to do is to remove the chemical that is causing the problem.

In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body.\"",
            "What exactly is a fart? The word \"fart\" can stand for: Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor. Farting, also known as flatulence, is the act of passing intestinal gas from the butt. Intestinal gas comes from several sources: air we swallow, gas that seeps into our intestines from our blood, gas produced by chemical reactions in our guts, and gas produced by bacteria living in our guts. Burps are not farts that come out your mouth. They have to do with your stomach.",

Boosters of the vaccine are recommended for adults because the benefits of the vaccine decrease with age; they are particularly recommended for those travelling to areas where the disease has not been eradicated yet. Signs and symptoms The respiratory form has an incubation time of 1-4 days. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, a mild sore throat and problems swallowing. Children infected have symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, chills, and a high fever, although some do not show symptoms until the infection has progressed further. Low blood pressure may develop in some patients. Longer-term effects include cardiomyopathy and peripheral neuropathy (sensory type)[1].",

        "answers": [
            "All tea comes from the same plant--black, green, and oolong teas all have the same parents. The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant. What does EGCG do? Research has shown that these polyphenolic antioxidants protects the body against cardiovascular disease, and promote a healthy immune system. However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, \u201cWe have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.\u201d The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea. It's also said to help reduce bad Cholestrol among many other help benefits which are still being researched. Yoyou will find several books and online claims about green tea - most of them are true but not all of them have been published in scientific journals yet because enough research has not been done yet. In short - it's good for you!",

Research suggests that EGCG in green tea contributes to cardiovascular health, boosts the immune system, and may inhibit the enzyme DHFR, a target for anti-cancer drugs. Despite numerous claims about green tea's health benefits, not all are scientifically substantiated due to ongoing research. In general, green tea is lauded for reducing bad cholesterol, offering an alkalizing effect on the body, in contrast to coffee's acidity, and providing a rich source of antioxidants."

Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as \"Turkey 'X' Disease\" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins. Natural occurrence: Food products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. Physical and chemical properties: Aflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins.",

The toothbrush rests on the charger without any metal contacts to connect the toothbrush to the base. This has the great advantage of allowing the toothbrush to be completely sealed so that water cannot enter through exposed contacts. It also avoids any problems with water getting into the contacts and shorting out the charger. This sort of sealed arrangement is called inductive charging. Essentially, the toothbrush and the base form a two-part transformer, with the base having one part of the transformer and the toothbrush having the other. When yoyou slide the toothbrush onto the base, the complete transformer is created and charge can flow. The base contains one of the coils and the metal bar. The toothbrush contains the second coil. When yoyou drop the toothbrush onto the base, yoyou create the complete transformer! </quote>"

        "answers": [
            "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). Multiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age. The exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system. The inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission). Recurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur. Researchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved. People with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease. Check out this article with excellent illustrations: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm",

MS is characterized by inflammation and damage to the white matter tissue in the central nervous system."

            "Haldol and prolixin are antipsychotic drugs, also formerly known as \"major tranquilizers\". They are the same class of drug as the animal tranquilizers used to shoot a wild tiger, etc. with to render him so calm that anything can be done with him, as if he was a pet. These drugs will calm any kind of agitation or excitement, such as the mania of a bipolar (manic depressive). These drugs make yoyou like a zombie. Yoyou may still be awake, but your emotions are paralyzed. There is no special effect on manic depressives. These drugs should not be used without strong reason to do so, as they can cause permanant neurological impairment, called Tardive Dyskinesia, where a person has involuntary movements usually of his mouth and face, even tounge. Also, these drugs cause temporary Parkinson like effects, making the user stiff, and making it difficult to initiate movement like getting out of a chair as well as akathesia, where the patient is very restless and can't sit or lay still.",

        "question": "what is thephysiology of thirst?",
        "answers": [
            "Thirst and drinking function to maintain body water balance and are basic to survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors. Thirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).",
            "To put it simply, yoyou loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water. Its caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain. IF yoyou are thirsty, yoyou are 1% dehyradted."

Unnatural thirst in disorders like fever and diabetes is caused by rapid reduction of body fluids. Thirst sensation is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, triggered by dehydration, leading to antidiuretic hormone release and signaling to drink and limit water excretion.
